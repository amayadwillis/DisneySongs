A Whole New World
Lyrics from Aladdin
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Lea Salonga as Jasmine and Brad Kane as Aladdin

[Aladdin:] I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Jasmine:] A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Aladdin:] Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Jasmine:] Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Jasmine:] A whole new world

[Aladdin:] Don't you dare close your eyes

[Jasmine:] A hundred thousand things to see

[Aladdin:] Hold your breath; it gets better

[Jasmine:] I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Aladdin:] A whole new world

[Jasmine:] Every turn a surprise

[Aladdin:] With new horizons to pursue

[Jasmine:] Every moment red-letter

[Both:] I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Aladdin:] A whole new world

[Jasmine:] A whole new world

[Aladdin:] That's where we'll be

[Jasmine:] That's where we'll be

[Aladdin:] A thrilling chase

[Jasmine:] A wondrous place

[Both:] For you and me

One Jump Ahead
Lyrics from Aladdin (Live-Action)
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Mena Massoud as Aladdin

[Aladdin:] Gotta keep one jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford (And that's everything!)
One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[Crowd:] Riffraff! Street rat! Scoundrel!
[Aladdin:] Take that! Try a different tack, guys
[Crowd:] Rip him open! Round the back, guys
[Aladdin:] I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
Could really use a friend or two

[Ladies:] Huh? Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[Crowd:] Stop, thief! Vandal! Abu! Scandal!
[Aladdin:] Let's not be too hasty
[Lady:] Still I think he's rather tasty
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along

[Aladdin:] One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
One hop ahead of the hump
One trick ahead of disaster
They're quick, but I'm much faster
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump

Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Mena Massoud as Aladdin

Riffraff! Street rat! I don't buy that!
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No, siree
They'd find out there's so much more to me

One Jump Ahead (Reprise 2)
Lyrics from Aladdin (Live-Action)
Music by Alan Menken
Lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul
Performed by Mena Massoud as Aladdin

Riffraff! Street rat! Would they think that
If they look much closer
Still, I can't play a prince here
No, siree

Gotta tell the truth
I can't pretend
Even if it means this dream will end
Even if she walks away from me

Forget About Love 
Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar
Lyrics and music by Patty Silversher and Michael Silversher
Performed by Gilbert Gottfried, Liz Callaway and Brad Kane

[Iago:] Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms

Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrills, the chills
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love

Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush

Love really is revolting
It's even worse than when you're molting
Enough of this fluff
Just forget about love

[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter

[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder

[Jasmine:] The first time we kissed

[Iago:] It won't be missed
Forget about his touch

[Jasmine:] I can't forget about his touch

[Iago:] In the scheme of things
It doesn't matter much

[Jasmine:] It matters so much

[Iago:] You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone

[Jasmine:] Hmm-mm-mm-mm

[Both:] Love's filled with compromises

[Iago:] And don't you hate those big surprises?

[Jasmine:] A cozy rendez-vous

[Iago:] Oh, please!

[Jasmine:] Candlelight for two

[Iago:] Oh, geez!

[Jasmine:] Look, you're calling my bluff, I can't

[Iago:] Just

[Both:] Forget about love!

[Jasmine:] I can't forget about my heart

[Aladdin:] I can't forget about my heart

[Jasmine:] And how it felt to fall for you right from the start

[Aladdin:] I'm still falling

[Jasmine:] Whatever we may do

[Aladdin:] Whatever we may do

[Jasmine:] You are here for me, and I'll be there for you

[Aladdin:] I'll be there

[Both:] To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun through rain and thunder

[Aladdin:] A cozy rendez-vous

[Jasmine:] Yes, please!

[Aladdin:] Candlelight for two

[Iago:] Oh, geez!
Enough is enough!

[Aladdin and Jasmine:] We can't forget about love!

Are You in or Out?
Lyrics from Aladdin and the King of Thieves
Composed by Randy Peterson and Kevin Quinn
Performed by Jerry Orbach as Sa'luk, with chorus

[Sa'luk:] I remember a time
When crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage
And ransack a village
With nary a worry or care

Then along came this king
With his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops
We were meant to regroup
And return to our roots once again!

Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best; success is guaranteed

Are you men or mice?
Take a slice of my advice
You want a fearless leader
One that's strong and stout?
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?

[Thieves:] We used to be smart, yes
Horrendously heartless
In a ravaging raid we were rough
We knew what we had
To be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff

And we strayed from the path
Of our rigorous wrath
Now we're taking a bath in the dust
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture we trust

[Sa'luk:] Are you in or out?
Double-crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me; pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity

Are you foe or friend?
Here's the path I recommend
You want a ride to fame?
I've got the fastest route
What's it gonna be?
Are you in or out?

[Thieves:] We'll go robbing in all the right places
From Agrabah dunes to Paris
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea

[Sa'luk:] Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout
I'll lead you all the way into the glory days

[Thieves:] We'll begin a life of crime that pays

Are you out or in?
Make your choice now: sink or swim

[Sa'luk:] You can stick with me
Or stay behind and pout
What's it gonna be?
Consider carefully
Are you in or out?

Father and Son
Lyrics from Aladdin and the King of Theives
Composed by Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn
Performed by Robin Williams, Brad Kane and Merwin Foard
[Genie:] It's a big, bright, beautiful future
Thank your lucky stars you're alive
You got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life

You've been on your own with no family ties
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind
Spending quality time
Together as father and son

Buildin' model ships
Takin' fishin' trips
Workin' hand in hand
Painting the palace, mowin' the sand
First at ten to go
With your daddy-o

Once you break the ice
You can postulate paternal advice
See, you're travelling at the speed of life
That's the theory of relatives!

It's a fine, fantabulous future
I see fruit on the family tree
You'll be great as a grumpy ol' grandpa
Bouncing babies on your knee!

You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playin' one-on-one
Reamin' back-to-back
Betcha wallop the Shaq
Together as father and son

[Cassim:] May be a bumpy ride

[Aladdin:] We'll make it side by side

[Genie:] Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Move over, Aladdin
Make room for dad!

You got a whole new shoulder to cry on
Take a chance now, give it a spin
You've had chums for palin' around with
But you never had a friend like him

Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big, bright, beautiful future
Together together, together, together as father and son
