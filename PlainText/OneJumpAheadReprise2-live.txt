One Jump Ahead (Reprise 2)
Lyrics from Aladdin (Live-Action)
Music by Alan Menken
Lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul
Performed by Mena Massoud as Aladdin

Riffraff! Street rat! Would they think that
If they look much closer
Still, I can't play a prince here
No, siree

Gotta tell the truth
I can't pretend
Even if it means this dream will end
Even if she walks away from me
