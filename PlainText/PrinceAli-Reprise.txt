Prince Ali (Reprise)
Lyrics from Aladdin
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Jonathan Freeman as Jafar

Jafar, Jasmine
Prince Ali, yes it is he, but not as you know him
Read my lips and come to grips with reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on, take it from me
His personality flaws give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip so his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen is in the ends of the Earth
Salaam, ex-prince Ali!
