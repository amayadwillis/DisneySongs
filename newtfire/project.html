		<p class="head"> Reaserch Question</p>
        <p>For this project, our team decided to collect and compare songs from Disney's Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast franchises. These two franchises were chosen because they had many reprises of the same songs, which could provide valuable information for our analysis. Our team is aiming to answer the research question of: <em class="quest">Do the songs (original and reprised versions) contain the same or similar words? What parts of speeches do these songs contain the most, and what does the variation in words mean? How much did the songs reflect the overall theme of the movies / franchises?</em></p> 
        <br/>
		<p class="head"> Source </p>
        <p>We used the song lyrics obtained from <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/" target="_blank">Disney Clips</a>. The site has a large collection of Disney songs separated by movie, and listed alphabetically. Our initial focus was on the Aladdin franchise since it was one of the largest franchises in the Disney Princesses genre. We then expanded to the Beauty and the Beast franchise, another big franchise of Disney with many repeating songs with reprises and live-action adaptations. We also discovered that there were a couple of songs from the two franchises that <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/" target="_blank">Disney Clips</a> did not include on their site. The lyrics for these songs were obtained from <a href="https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics" target="_blank">All The Lyrics</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Original-broadway-cast-of-beauty-and-the-beast" target="blank">Genuis.com</a>, and <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Disney_Wiki"> Disney Wiki</a> to update our corpus to include to the most accurate amount of the songs for each franchise. </p>

		<p class="head"> Limitations </p>
		<p>While we strive to present and produce the most accurate information and analysis possible, there are some limitations that exist within our project. 
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li> We are unable to access the original song scripts - meaning that the lyrics we used in our project is based purely on the released production of the songs and may be different to the original song scripts. </li>
		<li> We only have access to the information given to us by Disneyclips.com - meaning that there may be some missing information (composer, lyricist, actor, animator) from our project that we were unable to obtain and perform analysis on.</li>
		<li> We chose to exclude some of the songs from the Aladdin franchise in our project - there are some songs that are repetitive (end credits, reprises, separate parts etc.) that we chose to exclude so as to not muddle up the analysis process with duplicate information.</li>
		<li> We use the term "voice actor" to include all people involved in the movies, even for the live-action movies where there would be actual actors and actresses. </li></ol></body>
