		<p class="head"> Network Analysis </p>
        <p> To begin the process of network analysis, we first had to prepare our data accordingly from XML to TSV (Tab Separated Values) to allow us to then use the program Cytoscape to generate a network of relationships between our elements. Here is a gallery of the networks we were able to generate: (Click on each picture to interact with the network.)

		<div class="clearfix"></div>
		<p> By generating these networks, we were able to see the general groups of people that worked on the songs in the Aladdin franchise. For example, Alan Menken is the composers for most of the songs in the original movie, and is also the composer of the same songs for the live-action movie. </p>
		
		<p class="head"> Natural Language Analysis </p>
        <p> We ran all of our songs through Voyant Tools and documented the total words, unique words, and the top 5 most frequent words of each song. Here are the results:</p>
