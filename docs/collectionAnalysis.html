		<p class="head"> Network Analysis </p>
        <p> To begin the process of network analysis, we first had to prepare our data accordingly from XML to TSV (Tab Separated Values) to allow us to then use the program Cytoscape to generate a network of relationships between our elements. Here is a gallery of the networks we were able to generate: (Click on each picture to interact with the network.)

			<img src="images/voiceActor_songTitle.png" alt="voice actor from song titles" class="galleria"/></a></div><div class="desc">Voice Actors and Song Titles</div></div>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>
		<p> By generating these networks, we were able to see the general networks and interactions between people that worked on the songs in the Aladdin franchise. For example, Alan Menken is the composers for most of the songs in the original movie, and is also the composer of the same songs for the live-action movie. There are also pairs of composer that can be seen working together across songs in the franchise using the networks. </p>
		
		<p class="head"> Natural Language Analysis </p>
        <p> Although there were only 25 songs in our collection currently, the language used in these songs reflect a lot about the theme and overall intention of the songs, and may be deliberately chosen by the composers and Disney. For this part of our analysis, we used spaCy and Pycharm to conduct natural language processing over our entire collection, extracting interesting parts of speechs and elements in our collection to focus on.</p>

		<p class="subcomment">For these graphs, we focused on the nouns that were used in the Aladdin franchise.</p>
