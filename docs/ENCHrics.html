        <p>From picture books</p>
        <p>All filled with wonder</p>
        <p>Magic worlds where</p>
        <p>The impossible</p>

        <p>I'll lead because I know the way</p>
        
        <p>So much to discover</p>
        <p>I do it all the time</p>
        <p>I could live inside bright pages</p>
        <p>Where the words all rhyme</p>
        
        <p>We will slay the dragons</p>
        <p>That still follow him around</p>
        <p>And he'll smile, yes he'll smile</p>
        <p>As his dreams leave the ground</p>
        
        <p>Stories and stories</p>
        <p>'Bout mermaids, kings</p>
        <p>And sunken treasure</p>
        <p>Magic worlds where the impossible</p>
        <p>Becomes the everyday</p>
        
        <p>I know a tiny place</p>
        <p>Just a dot, too small to measure</p>
        <p>I'll take him there</p>
        <p>I know the way</p>
        
        <p>Stories 'bout heroes</p>
        <p>Who overcame their deepest sorrow</p>
        <p>They'll put hope into his heart again</p>
        <p>He'll cherish every day</p>
        
        <p>He'll find a better world</p>
        <p>And the strength to face tomorrow</p>
        <p>I'm sure that when he knows the way</p>
        <p>He'll want to stay</p>
