        <p>Every morning just the same</p>
        <p>Since the morning that we came</p>

        <p>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?</p>
        <p>Never part of any crowd</p>
        <p>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</p>
        <p>No denying she's a funny girl that Belle</p>

        <p>Bonjour! Good day! How is your wife?</p>
        <p>I need six eggs! That's too expensive!</p>

        <p>So, where did you run off to this week ?</p>
        
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle, spoken:]</span> Two cities in Northern Italy</p>
        <p>I didn't want to come back</p>
        <p>Have you got any new places to go?</p>

        <p><span class="townies">[Pere Robert, spoken:]</span> I'm afraid not...</p>
        <p>But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like</p>

        <p><span class="townies">[Townspeople:]</span> Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar</p>
        <p>I wonder if she's feeling well</p>
        <p>With a dreamy, far-off look</p>
        <p>And her nose stuck in a book</p>
        <p>What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle</p>
        
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> Oh, isn't this amazing?</p>
        <p>It's my favorite part because—you'll see</p>
        <p>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</p>
        <p>But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!</p>
        
        <p><span class="townies">[Townspeople:]</span> Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"</p>
        <p>Her looks have got no parallel</p>
        <p>But behind that fair facade</p>
        <p>I'm afraid she's rather odd</p>
        <p>Very diff'rent from the rest of us</p>
        <p>She's nothing like the rest of us</p>
        <p>Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!</p>

        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston, spoken:]</span>Look at her, LeFou—my future wife</p>

        <p><span class="lefou">[Lefou, spoken:]</span> But she's so... well-read!</p>

        <p><span class="lefou">[Lefou, spoken:]</span>... je ne sais quoi?</p>
        
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston, spoken:]</span> I don't know what that means</p>
        
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston, sung:]</span> Right from the moment when I met her, saw her</p>
        <p>I said she's gorgeous and I fell</p>
        <p>Here in town, there's only she</p>
        <p>Who is beautiful as me</p>
        <p>So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle</p>

        <p>Be still, my heart</p>
        <p>I'm hardly breathing</p>
        <p>He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!</p>

        <p>That girl is strange but special</p>
        <p>A most peculiar mademoiselle!</p>
        
        <p>It's a pity and a sin</p>

        <p>They can sing, they can dance</p>
        <p>After all, Miss, this is France</p>
        <p>And a dinner here is never second best</p>

        <p>And you're scared</p>
        <p>But the banquet's all prepared</p>
        <p>No one's gloomy or complaining</p>
        <p>While the flatware's entertaining</p>
        <p>We tell jokes! I do tricks</p>
        <p>With my fellow candlesticks!</p>
        
        <p><span class="castleware">[Castleware:]</span> And it's all in perfect taste</p>

        <p>Most days, we just lay around the castle</p>

        <p>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</p>
        <p>With dessert, she'll want tea</p>

        <p>Clean it up! We want the company impressed!</p>
        <p>We've got a lot to do</p>
        <p>Is it one lump or two?</p>

        <p>Course by course, one by one</p>
        <p>'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!"</p>
        <p>Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest</p>
        <p>Tonight, you'll prop your feet up</p>
        <p>But for now, let's eat up</p>

        <h2>How Does a Moment Last Forever</h2>
        <h6>Music from Beauty and the Beast</h6>
        <h6>Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Celine Dion</h6>
        
        <p><span class="bnblngram">How does</span> a moment last forever</p>
        <p>How can a story never die</p>
        <p>It is love we must hold onto</p>
        <p>Never easy, but we try</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes our happiness is captured</p>
        <p>Somehow our time and place stand still</p>
        <p>Love lives on inside our hearts</p>
        <p>And always will</p>
        
        <p>Minutes turn to hours</p>
        <p>Days to years, then gone</p>
        <p>But when all else has been forgotten</p>
        <p>Still our song lives on</p>
        
        <p>Maybe some moments weren't so perfect</p>
        <p>Maybe some memories not so sweet</p>
        <p>But we have to know some bad times</p>
        <p>For our lives are incomplete</p>
        
        <p>Then when the shadows overtake us</p>
        <p>Just when we feel all hope is gone</p>
        <p>We'll hear our song, and know once more</p>
        <p>Our love lives on</p>
        
        <p><span class="bnblngram">How does</span> a moment last forever</p>
        <p><span class="bnblngram">How does</span> our happiness endure</p>
        <p>Through the darkest of our troubles</p>
        <p>Love is beauty, love is pure</p>
        
        <p>Love pays no mind to desolation</p>
        <p>It flows like a river through the soul</p>
        <p>Protects, perceives and perseveres</p>
        <p>And makes us whole</p>
        
        <p>Minutes turn to hours</p>
        <p>Days to years, then gone</p>
        <p>But when all else has been forgotten</p>
        <p>Still our song lives on</p>
        
        <p><span class="bnblngram">How does</span> a moment last forever</p>
        <p>When our song lives on</p>
