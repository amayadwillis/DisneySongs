		<p class="head"> Reaserch Question</p>
        <p>For this project, our team decided to collect songs from Disney's Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast franchises and compare the songs within the movies. We chose to focus on these movies because they had many reprises of the same songs, which could provide valuable information for our analysis. Our team is aiming to answer the research question of: <em class="quest">Do the songs (original and reprised versions) contain the same or similar words? What parts of speeches do these songs contain the most, and what does the variation in words mean? How much did the songs reflect the overall theme of the movies / franchises?</em></p> 
        <br/>
		<p class="head"> Source </p>
        <p>We used the song lyrics obtained from <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/" target="_blank">Disneyclips.com</a>. The site has a large collection of Disney songs separated by movie, and listed alphabetically. After looking at the collection, we chose Aladdin because it was one of the larger movie series with many repeating songs that could yield interesting results after analysis. After clicking on a movie, the next screen that pops up has all of the songs from that movie. Once you click on one, it takes you to the page with the lyrics. This page also usually has a picture from the movie as well as some metadata such as the composer, voice actor(s), movie, etc.</p>

        <p>We also discovered later on that there were a couple Aladdin songs from a lesser known movie, so we had to update our files to include those as well. Since those songs were not on <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/" target="_blank">Disneyclips.com</a> we had to find a different source for the lyrics. We were able to find lyrics for these songs on <a href="http://disneyprincess.fandom.com/" target="_blank">disneyprincess.fandom.com/</a></p>

		<p class="head"> Limitations </p>
		<p>While we strive to present and produce the most accurate information and analysis possible, there are some limitations that exist within our project. 
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li> We are unable to access the original song scripts - meaning that the lyrics we used in our project is based purely on the released production of the songs and may be different to the original song scripts. </li>
		<li> We only have access to the information given to us by Disneyclips.com - meaning that there may be some missing information (composer, lyricist, actor, animator) from our project that we were unable to obtain and perform analysis on.</li>
		<li> We chose to exclude some of the songs from the Aladdin franchise in our project - there are some songs that are repetitive (end credits, reprises, separate parts etc.) that we chose to exclude so as to not muddle up the analysis process with duplicate information.</li>
		<li> We use the term "voice actor" to include all people involved in the movies, even for the live-action movies where there would be actual actors and actresses. </li></ol></body>
