		<p class="head"> Reaserch Question</p>
        <p align="left"> &emsp;&emsp; For this project, our team decided to collect songs from Disney's Aladdin franchise and compare the songs within the four movies (3 animated  and 1 live-action). We chose to focus on the Aladdin movies because they had many reprises of the same songs, which could provide valuable information for our analysis. Our team is aiming to answer the research question of: <em class="quest">Do the songs (original and reprised versions) contain the same or similar word? What parts of speeches do these songs contain the most, and what does the variation in words mean? How much did the songs reflect the overall theme of the movie / franchise?</em></p>

		<p class="head"> Source </p>
        <p align="left"> &emsp;&emsp; We used the song lyrics obtained from <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/" target="_blank">Disneyclips.com</a>. The site has a large collection of Disney songs separated by movie, and listed alphabetically. After looking at the collection, we chose Aladdin because it was one of the larger movie series with many repeating songs that could yield interesting results after analysis. After clicking on a movie, the next screen that pops up has all of the songs from that movie. Once you click on one, it takes you to the page with the lyrics. This page also usually has a picture from the movie as well as some metadata such as the composer, voice actor(s), movie, etc.</p>
