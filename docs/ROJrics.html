        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Follow me to a place where incredible feats</p>
        <p>Are routine every hour or so</p>
        <p>Where enchantment runs rampant</p>
        <p>Yes, wild in the streets</p>
        <p>Open sesame, here we go</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>They tease and excite</p>
        <p>Take off and take flight</p>
        <p>They shock and amaze</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>More often than not</p>
        <p>Are hotter than hot</p>
        <p>In a lot of good ways</p>
        
        <p>Pack your shield, pack your sword</p>
        <p>You won't ever get bored</p>
        <p>Though get beaten or gored you might</p>
        <p>Come on down, stop on by</p>
        <p>Hop a carpet and fly</p>
        <p>To another Arabian night</p>

        <p>That's it!</p>
        <p>I've had it!</p> 
        <p>I hate to be dramatic</p> 
        <p>But it's time for me to fly the coop</p> 
        <p>Terrific!</p> 
        <p>Fine!</p> 
        <p>I'm drawin' the line</p> 
        <p>Before I wind up in a parrot soup!</p> 
        
        <p>I was a fool to let you run the show</p>  
        <p>I'm cuttin' ya loose, pal!</p> 
        <p>Look out below!</p> 
        <p>Arrividerci!</p> 
        <p>C'est la vie!</p> 
        <p>Hope all goes well!</p> 
        <p>I'm lookin' out for me!</p> 
        
        <p>Okay! I'm little</p> 
        <p>Been playin' second fiddle</p> 
        <p>And I don't get no respect</p> 
        <p>I turn the other cheek</p> 
        <p>But this busted beak</p> 
        <p>Is the only thanks that I get!</p> 
        
        <p>I never found a friend that I can trust</p> 
        <p>They promise caviar</p> 
        <p>And leave me eatin' dust!</p> 
        <p>That's some reward for loyalty</p> 
        <p>From here on in</p> 
        <p>I'm lookin' out for me!</p> 
        
        <p>Oh, I don't need nobody else</p> 
        <p>I'll never fail</p> 
        <p>I'll cover my own tail</p> 
        <p>I can take care of myself!</p> 
        
        <p>You know, it just don't pay</p> 
        <p>To give a hoot</p> 
        <p>I'm givin' all my heart</p> 
        <p>What do I get?</p> 
        <p>The boot!</p> 
        <p>I'm through wit' dat</p> 
        <p>I'm flappin' free</p> 
        <p>From here on in</p> 
        <p>I'm lookin' out for me!</p>

        <h2>Nothing in the World (Quite Like a Friend)</h2>
        <h6>Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar</h6>
        <h6>Lyrics and music by Dale Gonyea and Michael Silversher</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Liz Callaway, Dan Castellaneta and Brad Kane</h6>
        
        <p>[Genie:] I parachuted down into the Taj Mahal</p> 
        <p>I rollerbladed all along the great Great Wall!</p>
        <p>I even made the famous Leaning Tower fall</p>
        <p>But who was with me through it all?</p>
        <p>Nobody!</p>
        
        <p>The Moscow Circus hired me to fly trapeze</p>
        <p>On Mount Olympus won a race with Hercules</p>
        <p>It's easy when you're chased by killer bees</p>
        <p>Who said "gesundheit" when I sneezed</p>
        
        <p>So now I'm home</p>
        <p>Home again with you</p>
        <p>You chase the clouds away</p>
        <p>Whenever I am blue</p>
        <p>(You're always blue)</p>
        <p>And the pyramids I highly recommend</p>
        <p>There is nothing in the world quite like a friend</p>
        
        <p>Slept like a babe in Bombay on a bed of nails</p>
        <p>Moroccans loved my daring dance of seven veils</p>
        <p>I single-handedly I even saved the whales</p>
        <p>No one was there to hear my tales!</p>
        
        <p>In Acapulco joined a Mariachi band</p>
        <p>I rode the ragin' rapids down the Rio Grande</p>
        <p>Flew in an air balloon, but when I tried to land</p>
        <p>Nobody laughed, or lent a hand</p>
        
        <p>Without you, the Amazon is just a trickle</p>
        <p>Without you, the Sahara's not so hot</p>
        <p>Without you, Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet</p>
        <p>And the QEII is just some yacht</p>
        
        <p>Now that I'm home</p>
        <p>Home again it's clear</p>
        <p>All I ever wanted </p>
        <p>Seems to be right here </p>
        <p>I've traveled east and west</p>
        <p>And now I'm back again</p>
        <p>And there's nothing in the world quite like a friend </p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] There's nothing in the world</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Nothing in the whole wide world</p>
        
        <p>[All:] There is nothing in the world quite like a friend</p>
        
        <p>[Genie:] Nothin' in the whole wide world!</p>

        <h2>Forget About Love</h2>

        <h6>Performed by Gilbert Gottfried, Liz Callaway and Brad Kane</h6>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Forget about that guy</p>
        <p>Forget about the way you fell into his eyes</p>
        <p>Forget about his charms</p>
        <p>Forget about the way he held you in his arms</p>
        
        <p>Walking on air's obnoxious</p>
        <p>The thrills, the chills</p>
        <p>Will make you nauseous</p>
        <p>And you'll never get enough</p>
        <p>Just forget about love</p>
        
        <p>Forget about romance</p>
        <p>Forget about the way your heart begins to dance</p>
        <p>Then you feel the blush</p>
        <p>When he's spouting out some sentimental mush</p>
        
        <p>Love really is revolting</p>
        <p>It's even worse than when you're molting</p>
        <p>Enough of this fluff</p>
        <p>Just forget about love</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt</p>
        <p>When he held out his hand for mine</p>
        <p>My heart all a-flutter</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] The first time we kissed</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] It won't be missed</p>
        <p>Forget about his touch</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] I can't forget about his touch</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] In the scheme of things</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter much</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] It matters so much</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] You're better on your own</p>
        <p>A meal becomes a banquet</p>
        <p>When you eat alone</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Hmm-mm-mm-mm</p>
        
        <p>[Both:] Love's filled with compromises</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] And don't you hate those big surprises?</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] A cozy rendez-vous</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Oh, please!</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Candlelight for two</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Oh, geez!</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Look, you're calling my bluff, I can't</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Just</p>
        
        <p>[Both:] Forget about love!</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] I can't forget about my heart</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] I can't forget about my heart</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] And how it felt to fall for you right from the start</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] I'm still falling</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Whatever we may do</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] Whatever we may do</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] You are here for me, and I'll be there for you</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] I'll be there</p>
        
        <p>[Both:] To wish, to want, to wander</p>
        <p>To find the sun through rain and thunder</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] A cozy rendez-vous</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Yes, please!</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] Candlelight for two</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] Oh, geez!</p>
        <p>Enough is enough!</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin and Jasmine:] We can't forget about love!</p>

        <p>I must admit, your parlor tricks are amusing</p>
        <p>I bet you've got a bunny under your hat</p> 
        <p>Now here's your chance to get the best of me</p>
        <p>Hope your hand is hot</p>
        <p>C'mon, clown, let's see what you've got</p>
        
        <p>You try to slam me with your hardest stuff</p>
        <p>But your double whammy isn't up to snuff</p>
        
        <p>I'll set the record straight</p>
        <p>You're simply out of date</p>
        <p>You're only second rate!</p>
        
        <p>You think your cat's a meanie, but your tiger's tame</p>
        <p>You've got a lot to learn about the genie game</p>
        <p>So for your education I'll reiterate</p>
        <p>You're only second rate!</p>
        
        <p>Men cower at the power in my pinky</p>
        <p>My thumb is number one on every list</p>
        <p>But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible</p>
        <p>Put me to the test</p>
        <p>I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest</p>
        
        <p>Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise</p>
        <p>Snap me in a trap, cut me down to size</p>
        <p>I'll make a great escape</p>
        <p>It's just a piece of cake</p>
        <p>You're only second rate!</p>
        
        <p>You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough</p>
        <p>And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up</p>
        <p>Let me pontificate upon your sorry state</p>
        <p>You're only second rate!</p>
        
        <p>Zaba-caba-dabra!</p>
        <p>Granny's gonna grab ya!</p>
        <p>Alakazam-da-mus</p>
        <p>And this thing's bigger than the both of us</p>
        
        <p>So spare me your tremendous scare</p>
        <p>You look horrendous in your underwear</p>
        <p>And I can hardly wait to discombobulate</p>
        <p>I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate</p>
        <p>You'd make a better living with a spinning plate</p>
        <p>You're only second rate!</p>
