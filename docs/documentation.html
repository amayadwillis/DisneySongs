		<p class="head">Plain Text</p>
		<p> To begin our project, we imported the lyrics and some metadata that we collected from our source from each of the 25 songs into separate plain texts files. These plain text files allow us to have the most basic file format of our collection as back-up, in case anything happened to our XML codes or anywhere in the analysis process.</p><figure><img src="images/PlainText_Example.JPG" alt="Example of the Plain Text Files" width="30%"><figcaption> An example of our plain text files </figcaption></figure>
		<p class="head">Mark up</p>
    <p>After obtaining the plain text files from the website, we used oXygen to mark the elements in the files with XML. We first identified repeating patterns in the files and used Regex (Regular Expressions) to mark up our files efficiently. Then, after the first files were marked propoerly with elements and attributes, we create a Relax NG Schema to keep our files and mark up style consistent with each other. We tried to keep in as many details as we could without making the code become too complicated, so we chose to separate the metadata part and the actual song part of the files with different tags. </p> <figure><img src="images/XML_Example.JPG" alt="Example of our XML code" width="40%"><figcaption> An example of our XML code </figcaption></figure>
		
		<p class="head">Analysis</p>
		<p>We utizlied eXist for the majority of the analysis process. eXist is a platform for us to write Xquery to pull specific data points from our collection and output them into formats to conduct further analysis or for visualization purposes. For a lot of the analysis we utilized eXist, where we wrote Xquery, which we used quite a bit for this project. We were able to utilize eXist while creating some svg graphs as well as writing code to extract elements to run through Cytocscape. We also used Voyant Tools to search through each individual song and find the words that repeated the most, the total words in the songs, and the amount of unique word forms in the songs.</p>

		<p class="subhead">Preparation for Network Analysis</p>
		<p>After determining what data we wanted to pull from our XML files, we created TSV files to hold a collection of data so that we could import them into Cytoscape later. Cytoscape is a software platform that allows you to output data through networks and diagrams. Inside Cytoscape, we generated networks using different elements such as voice actor, song titles or composer. 



As mentioned before, we imported our TSV files into Cytoscape and began to run the Network Analyzer in search for results. During this stage, we created diagrams that show connections and interactions between composers, song titles, and voice actors.

    <p class="head">GitHub</p>
		<p>We used GitHub to hold our collection of songs and all of our work, and also to publish our website. Our Github is public, if you'd like to take a look around and see how we operated on this project you can click <a href="https://github.com/amayadwillis/DisneySongs" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

Alongside the creations of our other file types, we created SVG files that visualize the text in forms of graphs. To create these we used HTML around our XML files. This allows us to form a graph with any variables we choose.
