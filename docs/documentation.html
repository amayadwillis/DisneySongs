		<p class="head"> Reaserch Question</p>
        <p align="left"> &emsp;&emsp;For this project, our team decided to collect songs from Disney's Aladdin franchise and compare the songs within the four movies (3 animated  and 1 live-action). We chose to focus on the Aladdin movies because they had many reprises of the same songs, which could provide valuable information for our analysis. Our team is aiming to answer the research question of: <em class="quest">Do the songs (original and reprised versions) contain the same or similar word? What parts of speeches do these songs contain the most, and what does the variation in words mean? How much did the songs reflect the overall theme of the movie / franchise?</em></p>

        <p align="left">&emsp;&emsp; We used the song lyrics obtained from <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/">Disneyclips.com</a>.The site has a large collection of Disney songs separated by movie, and listed alphabetically. After looking at the collection we chose Aladdin because it was one of the larger movie series. After clicking on a movie, the next screen that pops up has all of the songs from that movie. Once you click on one, it takes you to the page with the lyrics. This page also usually has a picture from the movie as well as some metadata such as the composer, voice actor(s), movie, etc.</p>
        
    <p align="left">&emsp;&emsp;We used oXygen to make our text and xml files. We used Regex to get our markup done quickly and to help us keep tags consistent. We also used oXygen to write our html for this webite. For a lot of the analysis we utilized eXist, this is where we wrote xquery, which we used quite a bit for this project. We were able to utilize eXist while creating some svg graphs as well as writing code to run through Cytocscape. We used Voyant Tools to search through each individual song and find the words that repeated the most, the total words in the songs, and the amount of unique word forms in the songs.</p>
  
        
    <p align="left">&emsp;&emsp;We used GitHub to hold our collection of songs and all of our work, and also to publish our website. Our Github is public, if you'd like to take a look around and see how we operated on this project you can click <a href="https://github.com/amayadwillis/DisneySongs">here.</a></p>
