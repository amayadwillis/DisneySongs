		<p class="head">Mark up</p>
    <p>After obtaining the plain text files from the website, we used oXygen to mark the elements in the files with XML. We first identified repeating patterns in the files and used Regex (Regular Expressions) to mark up our files efficiently. Then, after the first files were marked propoerly with elements and attributes, we create a Relax NG Schema to keep our files and mark up style consistent with each other. We tried to keep in as many details as we could without making the code become too complicated, so we chose to separate the metadata part and the actual song part of the files with different tags. </p> <figure><img src="images/XML_Example.JPG" alt="Example of our XML code" width="40%"></a><figcaption> An example of our XML code </figcaption></figure>
		
		<p class="head">Analysis</p>
		<p>We utizlied eXist for the majority of the analysis process. eXist is a platform for us to write Xquery to pull specific data points from our collection and output them into formats to conduct further analysis or for visualization purposes. For a lot of the analysis we utilized eXist, this is where we wrote xquery, which we used quite a bit for this project. We were able to utilize eXist while creating some svg graphs as well as writing code to run through Cytocscape. We used Voyant Tools to search through each individual song and find the words that repeated the most, the total words in the songs, and the amount of unique word forms in the songs.</p>
  
        
    <p class="head">GitHub</p>
		<p>We used GitHub to hold our collection of songs and all of our work, and also to publish our website. Our Github is public, if you'd like to take a look around and see how we operated on this project you can click <a href="https://github.com/amayadwillis/DisneySongs" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
