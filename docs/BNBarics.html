        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> Little town</p>
        <p>It's a quiet village</p>
        <p>Every day</p>
        <p>Like the one before</p>
        <p>Little town full of little people</p>
        <p>Waking up to say</p>
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Bonjour! Bonjour!</p>
        <p>Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!</p>
        
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> here goes the baker with his tray like always</p>
        <p>The same old bread and rolls to sell</p>
        <p>Every morning just the same</p>
        <p>Since the morning that we came</p>
        <p>To this poor provincial town</p>
        
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Look, there she goes, the girl is strange, no question</p>
        <p>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?</p>
        <p>Never part of any crowd</p>
        <p>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</p>
        <p>No denying she's a funny girl, that Belle</p>
        
        <p>Bonjour</p>
        <p>Good day</p>
        <p>How is your family?</p>
        <p>Bonjour</p>
        <p>Good day</p>
        <p>How is your wife?</p>
        <p>I need six eggs</p>
        <p>That's too expensive</p>
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> There must be more than this provincial life</p>
        
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Look, there she goes</p>
        <p>That girl is so peculiar</p>
        <p>I wonder if she's feeling well</p>
        <p>With a dreamy, far-off look</p>
        <p>And her nose stuck in a book</p>
        <p>What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle</p>

        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> Oh, isn't this amazing?</p>
        <p>It's my favorite part because...you'll see</p>
        <p>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</p>
        <p>But she won't discover that it's him till chapter three</p>
        
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Now, it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"</p>
        <p>Her looks have got no parallel</p>
        <p>But behind that fair facade</p>
        <p>I'm afraid she's rather odd</p>
        <p>Very different from the rest of us</p>
        <p>She's nothing like the rest of us</p>
        <p>Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle</p>
        
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span> Right from the moment when I met her, saw her</p>
        <p>I said she's gorgeous and I fell</p>
        <p>Here in town there's only she</p>
        <p>Who is beautiful as me</p>
        <p>So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle</p>
        
        <p><span class="bimbettes">[Bimbettes:]</span> Look, there he goes</p>
        <p>Isn't he dreamy?</p>
        <p>Monsieur Gaston</p>
        <p>Oh, he's so cute</p>
        <p>Be still, my heart</p>
        <p>I'm hardly breathing</p>
        <p>He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute</p>
        
        <p>Bonjour</p>
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span> Pardon</p>
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Good day</p>
        <p>Mais oui</p>
        <p>You call this bacon?</p>
        <p>What lovely grapes</p>
        <p>Some cheese...</p>
        <p>Ten yards</p>
        <p>One pound</p>
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span> 'Scuse me</p>
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> I'll get the knife</p>
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span>Please let me through!</p>
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> This bread</p>
        <p>Those fish</p>
        <p>It's stale</p>
        <p>They smell</p>
        <p>Madame's mistaken</p>
        
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> There must be more than this provincial life</p>
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span> Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!</p>
        
        <p><span class="townies">[Chorus:]</span> Look, there she goes, a girl who's strange but special</p>
        <p>A most peculiar mademoiselle</p>
        <p>It's a pity and a sin</p>
        <p>She doesn't quite fit in</p>
        <p>'Cause she really is a funny girl</p>
        <p>A beauty but a funny girl</p>
        <p>She really is a funny girl, that Belle!</p>

        <p>Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston</p>
        <p>Even when taking your lumps</p>
        
        <p>There's no man in town as admired as you</p>

        <p><span class="lumiere">[Lumiere:]</span> Life is so unnerving</p>
        <p>For a servant who's not serving</p>

        <p>Ah, those good old days when we were useful</p>
        <p>Suddenly, those good old days are gone</p>
        
        <p>Ten years we've been rusting</p>
        <p>Needing so much more than dusting</p>
        <p>Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills</p>
        <p>Most days we just lay around the castle</p>
        <p>Flabby, fat and lazy</p>
        <p>You walked in and oops-a-daisy!</p>

        <p>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</p>
        
        <p>With dessert</p>
        <p>She'll want tea</p>
        <p>And, my dear, that's fine with me</p>
        <p>While the cups do their soft-shoeing</p>
        <p>I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing</p>
        
        <p>I'll get warm</p>
        <p>Piping hot</p>
        <p>Heaven's sake, is that a spot?</p>
        <p>Clean it up, we want the company impressed</p>
        
        <p>We've got a lot to do</p>

        <p>With your meal</p>
        <p>With your ease</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed, we aim to please</p>
        <p>While the candlelight's still glowing</p>
        <p>Let us help you, we'll keep going</p>
        
        <p>Course by course</p>
        <p>One by one</p>
        <p>Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"</p>
        <p>Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest</p>
        
        <p>Tonight you'll prop your feet up</p>
        <p>But for now, let's eat up</p>

        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> There's something sweet and almost kind</p>
        <p>But he was mean, and he was coarse and unrefined</p>
        <p>And now he's dear and so unsure</p>
        <p>I wonder why I didn't see it there before</p>
        
        <p><span class="beast">[Beast:]</span> She glanced this way, I thought I saw</p>

        <p>But then she's never looked at me that way before</p>
        
        <p><span class="belle">[Belle:]</span> New and a bit alarming</p>
        <p>Who'd have ever thought that this could be?</p>
        <p>True that he's no Prince Charming</p>

        <p><span class="castleware">[Castleware:]</span> Well, who'd have thought?</p>
        <p>Well, bless my soul</p>
        <p>Well, who'd have known?</p>
        <p>Well, who indeed?</p>
        <p>And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?</p>
        <p>It's so peculiar</p>
        
        <p>Wait and see a few days more</p>
        <p>There may be something there that wasn't there before</p>
        <p>There may be something there that wasn't there before</p>

        <p><span class="townies">[Mob:]</span> We're not safe until he's dead</p>
        <p>He'll come stalking us at night</p>
        <p>Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite</p>
        <p>He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free</p>
        
        <p><span class="gaston">[Gaston:]</span> So it's time to take some action, boys</p>
        <p>It's time to follow me</p>
        
        <p>Through the mist, through the woods</p>
        <p>Through the darkness and the shadows</p>
        <p>It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride</p>
        
        <p>Say a prayer, then we're there</p>
        <p>At the drawbridge of a castle</p>
        <p>And there's something truly terrible inside</p>
        
        <p>It's a beast; he's got fangs, razor-sharp ones</p>
        <p>Massive paws, killer claws for the feast</p>
        
        <p>Hear him roar, see him foam</p>
        <p>But we're not coming home</p>
        <p>Till he's dead, good and dead!</p>

        <p>Through the mist, through the wood</p>

        <p>Something's lurking that you don't see every day</p>
        
        <p>It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain</p>
        <p>We won't rest till he's good and deceased</p>
