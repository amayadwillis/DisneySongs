        <p>Welcome to the Disney Project Page!</p>
        <p>Our team decided to compare songs from Disney's Aladdin movies. This includes not only the three animated ones, but the live action one as well. We thought it would be interesting to see how many of the songs contain the same or similar words as well as how many songs different characters sing.</p>
        <p>more to come...</p>
