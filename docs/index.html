        <p>Welcome to the Disney Project Page!</p>
        <p align="left">Our team decided to compare songs from Disney's Aladdin movies. This includes not only the three animated ones, but the live action one as well. We thought it would be interesting to see how many of the songs contain the same or similar words.</p> 
        <p align="left">We used <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> q  xtools to search through each individual song and find the words that repeated the most, the total words in the songs, and the amount of unique word forms in the songs.</p>
        <p align="left">For the song lyrics we used <a href="https://www.disneyclips.com/lyrics/">Disneyclips.com.</a> The site has a large collection of Disney songs separated by movie, and listed alphabetically. After looking at the collection we chose Aladdin because it was one of the larger movie series. After clicking on a movie, the next screen that pops up has all of the songs from that movie. Once you click on one, it takes you to the page with the lyrics. This page also usually has a picture from the movie as well as some metadata such as the composer, voice actor(s), movie, etc.</p>
        <p align="left">We used GitHub to hold our collection of songs and all of our work, and also to publish our website. Our Github is public, if you'd like to take a look around and see how we operated on this project you can click <a href="https://github.com/amayadwillis/DisneySongs">here</a></p>
