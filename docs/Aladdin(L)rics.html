        <h6>Lyrics from Aladdin (Live-Action)</h6>
        <h6>Music by Alan Menken</h6>
        <h6>Lyrics by Howard Ashman, with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Will Smith</h6>
               
        <p><span class="peddler">[Peddler:]</span> Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place</p>
        <p>Where the caravan camels roam</p>
        <p>Where you wander among every culture and tongue</p>
        <p>It's chaotic, but, hey, it's home</p>
        
        <p>When the wind's from the East, and the sun's from the West</p>
        <p>And the sand in the glass is right</p>
        <p>Come on down, stop on by</p>
        <p>Hop a carpet and fly</p>
        <p>To another Arabian night</p>
        
        <p>As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars</p>
        <p>With the cardamom-cluttered stalls</p>
        <p>You can smell every spice</p>
        <p>While you haggle the price</p>
        <p>Of the silks and the satin shawls</p>
        
        <p>Oh, the music that plays as you move through a maze</p>
        <p>In the haze of your pure delight</p>
        <p>You are caught in a dance</p>
        <p>You are lost in the trance</p>
        <p>Of another Arabian night</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>More often than not are hotter than hot</p>
        <p>In a lot of good ways</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian dreams</p>
        <p>This mystical land of magic and sand</p>
        <p>Is more than it seems</p>
        
        <p>There's a road that may lead you</p>
        <p>To good or to greed through</p>
        <p>The power your wishing commands</p>
        <p>Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold</p>
        <p>Well, your destiny lies in your hands</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>They seem to excite, take off and take flight</p>
        <p>To shock and amaze</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>'Neath Arabian moons</p>
        <p>A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard</p>
        <p>Out there on the dunes</p>

        <h6>Performed by Naomi Scott as Jasmine</h6>
        
        <p><span class="jasmine">[Jasmine:]</span> Here comes a wave meant to wash me away</p>
        <p>A tide that is taking me under</p>
        <p>Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say</p>
        <p>My voice drowned out in the thunder</p>
        
        <p>But <span class="alngram">I won't</span> cry</p>
        <p>And <span class="alngram">I won't</span> start to crumble</p>
        <p>Whenever they try to shut me or cut me down</p>
        
        <p><span class="alngram">I won't</span> be silenced</p>
        <p>You can't keep me quiet</p>
        <p>Won't tremble when you try it</p>
        <p>All I know is <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        <p>'Cause I'll breathe when they try to suffocate me</p>
        <p>Don't you underestimate me</p>
        <p>'Cause I know that <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        
        <p>Written in stone, every rule, every word</p>
        <p>Centuries old and unbending</p>
        <p>Stay in your place, better seen and not heard</p>
        <p>Well, now that story's ending</p>
        
        <p>'Cause I, I cannot start to crumble</p>
        <p>So come on and try</p>
        <p>Try to shut me and cut me down</p>
        
        <p><span class="alngram">I won't</span> be silenced</p>
        <p>You can't keep me quiet</p>
        <p>Won't tremble when you try it</p>
        <p>All I know is <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
        
        <p>Let the storm in</p>
        <p>I cannot be broken</p>
        <p>No, <span class="alngram">I won't</span> live unspoken</p>
        <p>'Cause I know that <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        
        <p>Try to lock me in this cage</p>
        <p><span class="alngram">I won't</span> just lay me down and die</p>
        <p>I will take these broken wings</p>
        <p>And watch me burn across the sky</p>
        <p>Hear the echo saying</p>
        
        <p><span class="alngram">I won't</span> be silenced</p>
        <p>Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it</p>
        <p>All I know is <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
        <p>'Cause I'll breathe when they try to suffocate me</p>
        <p>Don't you underestimate me</p>
        <p>'Cause I know that <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        <p>All I know is <span class="alngram">I won't</span> <span class="alngram">go speechless</span></p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
