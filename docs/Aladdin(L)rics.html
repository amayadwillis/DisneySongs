        <h6>Lyrics from Aladdin (Live-Action)</h6>
        <h6>Music by Alan Menken</h6>
        <h6>Lyrics by Howard Ashman, with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Will Smith</h6>
        
        
        <p>Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place</p>
        <p>Where the caravan camels roam</p>
        <p>Where you wander among every culture and tongue</p>
        <p>It's chaotic, but, hey, it's home</p>
        
        <p>When the wind's from the East, and the sun's from the West</p>
        <p>And the sand in the glass is right</p>
        <p>Come on down, stop on by</p>
        <p>Hop a carpet and fly</p>
        <p>To another Arabian night</p>
        
        <p>As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars</p>
        <p>With the cardamom-cluttered stalls</p>
        <p>You can smell every spice</p>
        <p>While you haggle the price</p>
        <p>Of the silks and the satin shawls</p>
        
        <p>Oh, the music that plays as you move through a maze</p>
        <p>In the haze of your pure delight</p>
        <p>You are caught in a dance</p>
        <p>You are lost in the trance</p>
        <p>Of another Arabian night</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>More often than not are hotter than hot</p>
        <p>In a lot of good ways</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian dreams</p>
        <p>This mystical land of magic and sand</p>
        <p>Is more than it seems</p>
        
        <p>There's a road that may lead you</p>
        <p>To good or to greed through</p>
        <p>The power your wishing commands</p>
        <p>Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold</p>
        <p>Well, your destiny lies in your hands</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>They seem to excite, take off and take flight</p>
        <p>To shock and amaze</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>'Neath Arabian moons</p>
        <p>A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard</p>
        <p>Out there on the dunes</p>

        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta keep one jump ahead of the breadline</p>
        <p>One swing ahead of the sword</p>
        <p>I steal only what I can't afford (And that's everything!)</p>
        <p>One jump ahead of the lawmen</p>
        <p>That's all, and that's no joke</p>
        <p>These guys don't appreciate I'm broke</p>
        
        <p>[Crowd:] Riffraff! Street rat! Scoundrel!</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Take that! Try a different tack, guys</p>
        <p>[Crowd:] Rip him open! Round the back, guys</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] I can take a hint, gotta face the facts</p>
        <p>Could really use a friend or two</p>
        
        <p>[Ladies:] Huh? Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom</p>
        <p>He's become a one-man rise in crime</p>
        <p>I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat</p>
        <p>Tell you all about it when I got the time!</p>
        
        <p>One jump ahead of the slowpokes</p>
        <p>One skip ahead of my doom</p>
        <p>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</p>
        <p>One jump ahead of the hitmen</p>
        <p>One hit ahead of the flock</p>
        <p>I think I'll take a stroll around the block</p>
        
        <p>[Crowd:] Stop, thief! Vandal! Abu! Scandal!</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Let's not be too hasty</p>
        <p>[Lady:] Still I think he's rather tasty</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat</p>
        <p>Otherwise we'd get along</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] One jump ahead of the hoofbeats</p>
        <p>One hop ahead of the hump</p>
        <p>One trick ahead of disaster</p>
        <p>They're quick, but I'm much faster</p>
        <p>Here goes, better throw my hand in</p>
        <p>Wish me happy landin'</p>
        <p>All I gotta do is jump</p>

        <p>With his bears and lions</p>
        <p>A brass band and more</p>
        <p>(What?)</p>
        <p>With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers</p>
        <p>His birds that warble on key</p>

        <p>Here comes a wave meant to wash me away</p>

        <p>My voice drowned out in the thunder</p>

        <p>You can't keep me quiet</p>
        <p>Won't tremble when you try it</p>
        <p>All I know is I won't go speechless</p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
        
        <p>Let the storm in</p>
        <p>I cannot be broken</p>
        <p>No, I won't live unspoken</p>
        <p>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless</p>
        
        <p>Try to lock me in this cage</p>
        <p>I won't just lay me down and die</p>
        <p>I will take these broken wings</p>
        <p>And watch me burn across the sky</p>
        <p>Hear the echo saying</p>
        
        <p>I won't be silenced</p>
        <p>Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it</p>
        <p>All I know is I won't go speechless</p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
        <p>'Cause I'll breathe when they try to suffocate me</p>
        <p>Don't you underestimate me</p>
        <p>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless</p>
        <p>All I know is I won't go speechless</p>
        <p>Speechless!</p>
