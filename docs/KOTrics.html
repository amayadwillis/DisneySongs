        <h2>There's a Party Here in Agrabah</h2>
        <h6>Lyrics from Aladdin and the King of Thieves</h6>
        <h6>Composed by David Friedman</h6>
        
        <p>[Genie:] There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>There's excitement in the air</p>
        <p>People pouring in from near and far</p>
        <p>'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'</p>
        
        <p>There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>Everybody will be there</p>
        <p>So if you're a pauper or a shah</p>
        <p>Do somethin' with your hair</p>
        
        <p>You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty</p>
        <p>A turban that's unraveling just won't do</p>
        <p>No earrings that are tasteless or gaudy</p>
        <p>You're gonna look gorgeous when I get through</p>
        
        <p>There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>So I'm going to paint the town</p>
        <p>If you want to see what colors are</p>
        <p>Follow me around</p>
        
        <p>Aladdin's gettin' married, and it's gonna be</p>
        <p>The wedding of the century</p>
        <p>My buddy's gettin' married, and you're gonna see</p>
        <p>Just how much I can do</p>
        
        <p>You've heard of your safari bar mitzvahs</p>
        <p>You've all been to a luau, a sweet sixteen</p>
        <p>Well, none of them compare to what this is</p>
        <p>The food'll be disgusting, by evening you'll be bustin</p>g
        
        <p>There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>And it's got us all aglow</p>
        <p>If a street rat could've come so far</p>
        <p>Maybe I could do it</p>
        <p>Sure, there's nothin' to it!</p>
        
        <p>There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>But we're not sure that we'll go</p>
        <p>For although the bride is lah-dee-dah</p>
        <p>The groom is awfully low</p>
        
        <p>And now we take you down to the palace</p>
        <p>Where everyone has celebrated all night long</p>
        <p>Without Jafar and all of his malice</p>
        <p>Everybody's happy</p>
        <p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
        
        <p>[Thieves:] There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>And we're gonna rob 'em blind</p>
        
        <p>[Cassim:] While they're all munching caviar</p>
        <p>Create a small disturbance, I'll sneak up from behind</p>
        
        <p>[Iago:] There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>And the loot is pourin' in</p>
        <p>I like this wedding stuff so far</p>
        <p>Maybe if I'm pleasant, I'll get to keep a present</p>
        
        <p>[Genie:] We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers</p>
        <p>The valets will carefully park for you</p>
        <p>The bridesmaids have been dressing for hours!</p>
        <p>Girls, you look just lovely and so grown-up, too</p>
        
        <p>There's a party here in Agrabah</p>
        <p>Guests are filling up the room</p>
        <p>But there's something missing...yes, ah ha!</p>
        
        <p>[Sultan:] Where is the groom?</p>

        <h6>Composed by David Friedman</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Brad Kane and Liz Callaway</h6>
        
        <p>Jasmine, Aladdin</p>
        <p>[Jasmine:] You showed me the world</p>
        <p>When I was all locked up inside</p>
        <p>You reached out your hand</p>
        <p>And took me on a magic carpet ride</p>
        
        <p>One look at your smile</p>
        <p>And I could see the light</p>
        <p>Shining everywhere</p>
        <p>People like you don't come out of thin air</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] Oh, Jasmine</p>
        <p>You don't understand</p>
        <p>There is so much that you don't see</p>
        <p>Just think, if you can</p>
        <p>What growing up had to be like for me</p>
        
        <p>Your father's a man</p>
        <p>Who taught you who you are</p>
        <p>Mine was never there</p>
        <p>So how can you say I don't come out of thin air?</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] There's so much I want to know</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] You've got the chance to learn</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] If it means I'd have to go</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] I'll be right here when you return</p>
        <p>Our wedding can wait</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] I love you</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] I think it's worth this small delay</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] Maybe you're right</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] And won't it be great</p>
        <p>To have your father see our wedding day?</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] I've waited so long</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] It isn't too late</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] To learn the truth</p>
        
        <p>[Both:] And now at last, we can finally say</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Your father is really there</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] There's so much that we might share</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] And you'll finally learn</p>
        
        <p>[Both:] You don't come out of thin air</p>

        <p>[Genie:] It's a big, bright, beautiful future</p>
        <p>Thank your lucky stars you're alive</p>
        <p>You got someone special to talk to</p>
        <p>A friend that you can trust for life</p>
        
        <p>You've been on your own with no family ties</p>
        <p>But those solo days are done</p>
        <p>You'll be two of a kind</p>

        <p>That's the theory of relatives!</p>
        
        <p>It's a fine, fantabulous future</p>
        <p>I see fruit on the family tree</p>

        <h2>Are You in or Out?</h2>
        <h6>Lyrics from Aladdin and the King of Thieves</h6>
        <h6>Composed by Randy Peterson and Kevin Quinn</h6>
        <h6>Performed by Jerry Orbach as Sa'luk, with chorus</h6>
        
        <p>[Sa'luk:] I remember a time</p>
        <p>When crime was sublime</p>
        <p>There was plenty of loot in the lair</p>
        <p>We'd plunder and pillage</p>
        <p>And ransack a village</p>
        <p>With nary a worry or care</p>
        
        <p>Then along came this king</p>
        <p>With his soft-hearted dream</p>
        <p>But he ratted us out in the end</p>
        <p>So rally the troops</p>
        <p>We were meant to regroup</p>
        <p>And return to our roots once again!</p>
        
        <p>Are you in or out?</p>
        <p>Gotta know without a doubt</p>
        <p>I'm the one you need for a dirty deed</p>
        <p>I'm the best; success is guaranteed</p>
        
        <p>Are you men or mice?</p>
        <p>Take a slice of my advice</p>
        <p>You want a fearless leader</p>
        <p>One that's strong and stout?</p>
        <p>Better vote for me</p>
        <p>Are you in or out?</p>
        
        <p>[Thieves:] We used to be smart, yes</p>
        <p>Horrendously heartless</p>
        <p>In a ravaging raid we were rough</p>
        <p>We knew what we had</p>
        <p>To be blissfully bad</p>
        <p>Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff</p>
        
        <p>And we strayed from the path</p>
        <p>Of our rigorous wrath</p>
        <p>Now we're taking a bath in the dust</p>
        <p>But we'll reclaim our winnings</p>
        <p>Our humble beginnings</p>
        <p>In turmoil and torture we trust</p>
        
        <p>[Sa'luk:] Are you in or out?</p>
        <p>Double-crossers or devout?</p>
        <p>Put your faith in me; pretty soon you'll see</p>
        <p>I'm the prince of generosity</p>
        
        <p>Are you foe or friend?</p>
        <p>Here's the path I recommend</p>
        <p>You want a ride to fame?</p>
        <p>I've got the fastest route</p>
        <p>What's it gonna be?</p>
        <p>Are you in or out?</p>
        
        <p>[Thieves:] We'll go robbing in all the right places</p>
        <p>From Agrabah dunes to Paris</p>
        <p>Imagine the fear on their faces</p>
        <p>When we drop by for cookies and tea</p>
        
        <p>[Sa'luk:] Are you in or out?</p>
        <p>If you're with me, give a shout</p>
        <p>I'll lead you all the way into the glory days</p>
        
        <p>[Thieves:] We'll begin a life of crime that pays</p>
        
        <p>Are you out or in?</p>
        <p>Make your choice now: sink or swim</p>
        
        <p>[Sa'luk:] You can stick with me</p>
        <p>Or stay behind and pout</p>
        <p>What's it gonna be?</p>
        <p>Consider carefully</p>
        <p>Are you in or out?</p>
