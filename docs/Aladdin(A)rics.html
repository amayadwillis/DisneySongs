        <p>And the heat is intense</p>
        <p>It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home</p>
        
        <p>When the wind's from the East</p>
        <p>And the sun's from the West</p>
        <p>And the sand in the glass is right</p>
        <p>Come on down</p>
        <p>Stop on by</p>

        <p><span class="jafar">[Jafar:]</span> <span class="aangram">Prince Ali</span>, yes it is he, but not as you know him</p>
        <p>Read my lips and come to grips with reality</p>
        <p>Yes, meet a blast from your past</p>
        <p>Whose lies were too good to last</p>
        <p>Say hello to your precious <span class="aangram">Prince Ali</span>!</p>
        
        <p>So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin</p>
        <p>Just a con, need I go on, take it from me</p>
        <p>His personality flaws give me adequate cause</p>
        <p>To send him packing on a one-way trip so his prospects take a terminal dip</p>
        <p>His assets frozen, the venue chosen is in the ends of the Earth</p>
        <p>Salaam, ex-prince Ali!</p>
