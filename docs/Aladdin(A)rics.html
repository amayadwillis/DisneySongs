        <p>Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place</p>
        <p>Where the caravan camels roam</p>
        <p>Where it's flat and immense</p>
        <p>And the heat is intense</p>
        <p>It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home</p>
        
        <p>When the wind's from the East</p>
        <p>And the sun's from the West</p>
        <p>And the sand in the glass is right</p>
        <p>Come on down</p>
        <p>Stop on by</p>
        <p>Hop a carpet and fly</p>
        <p>To another Arabian night</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>Like Arabian days</p>
        <p>More often than not</p>
        <p>Are hotter than hot</p>
        <p>In a lot of good ways</p>
        
        <p>Arabian nights</p>
        <p>'Neath Arabian moons</p>
        <p>A fool off his guard</p>
        <p>Could fall and fall hard</p>
        <p>Out there on the dunes</p>

        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta keep one jump ahead of the breadline</p>
        <p>One swing ahead of the sword</p>
        <p>I steal only what I can't afford (That's everything!)</p>
        <p>One jump ahead of the lawmen</p>
        <p>That's all, and that's no joke</p>
        <p>These guys don't appreciate I'm broke</p>
        
        <p>[Crowd:] Riffraff! Street rat! Scoundrel! Take that!</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Just a little snack, guys</p>
        <p>[Crowd:] Rip him open, take it back, guys</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] I can take a hint, gotta face the facts</p>
        <p>You're my only friend, Abu!</p>
        <p>[Crowd:] Who?</p>
        
        <p>[Ladies:] Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom</p>
        <p>He's become a one-man rise in crime</p>
        <p>I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat</p>
        <p>Tell you all about it when I got the time!</p>
        
        <p>One jump ahead of the slowpokes</p>
        <p>One skip ahead of my doom</p>
        <p>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</p>
        <p>One jump ahead of the hitmen</p>
        <p>One hit ahead of the flock</p>
        <p>I think I'll take a stroll around the block</p>
        
        <p>[Crowd:] Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Let's not be too hasty</p>
        <p>[Lady:] Still I think he's rather tasty</p>
        <p>[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat</p>
        <p>Otherwise we'd get along</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] One jump ahead of the hoofbeats (Vandal!)</p>
        <p>One hop ahead of the hump (Streetrat!)</p>
        <p>One trick ahead of disaster (Scandal!)</p>
        <p>They're quick, but I'm much faster (Take that!)</p>
        <p>Here goes, better throw my hand in</p>
        <p>Wish me happy landin'</p>
        <p>All I gotta do is jump</p>

        <p>Say hey, it's Prince Ali</p>
        
        <p>Hey, clear the way in the old Bazaar</p>
        <p>Hey you, let us through</p>
        <p>It's a bright new star</p>
        <p>Oh, come!</p>
        <p>Be the first on your block to meet his eye!</p>
        
        <p>Make way, here he comes</p>
        <p>Ring bells! Bang the drums!</p>
        <p>You're gonna love this guy</p>
        
        <p>Prince Ali! Fabulous he, Ali Ababwa</p>
        <p>Genuflect, show some respect</p>
        <p>Down on one knee</p>
        <p>Now, try your best to stay calm</p>
        <p>Brush up your Sunday salaam</p>
        <p>Then come and meet his spectacular coterie</p>
        
        <p>Prince Ali! Mighty is he, Ali Ababwa</p>
        <p>Strong as ten regular men, definitely</p>
        <p>He faced the galloping hordes</p>
        <p>A hundred bad guys with swords</p>
        <p>Who sent those goons to their lords?</p>
        <p>Why, Prince Ali</p>
        
        <p>He's got seventy-five golden camels</p>
        <p>Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three</p>
        <p>When it comes to exotic-type mammals</p>
        <p>Has he got a zoo?</p>
        <p>I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie</p>
        
        <p>Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa</p>
        <p>That physique! How can I speak</p>
        <p>Weak at the knee</p>
        <p>Well, get on out in that square</p>
        <p>Adjust your veil and prepare</p>
        <p>To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali</p>
        
        <p>He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys</p>
        <p>(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)</p>
        <p>And to view them he charges no fee</p>
        <p>(He's generous, so generous)</p>
        <p>He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies</p>
        <p>(Proud to work for him)</p>
        <p>They bow to his whim, love serving him</p>
        <p>They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!</p>
        <p>Prince Ali!</p>
        
        <p>Prince Ali! Amorous he, Ali Ababwa</p>
        <p>Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see</p>
        <p>And that, good people, is why</p>
        <p>He got dolled up and dropped by</p>
        <p>With sixty elephants, llamas galore</p>
        <p>With his bears and lions</p>
        <p>A brass band and more</p>
        <p>With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers</p>
        <p>His birds that warble on key</p>

        <p>Shining, shimmering, splendid</p>
        <p>Tell me, princess, now when did</p>
        <p>You last let your heart decide</p>
        
        <p>I can open your eyes</p>
        <p>Take you wonder by wonder</p>
        <p>Over, sideways and under</p>
        <p>On a magic carpet ride</p>
        
        <p>A whole new world</p>
        <p>A new fantastic point of view</p>
        <p>No one to tell us no</p>

        <p>Or say we're only dreaming</p>

        <p>A dazzling place I never knew</p>
        <p>But now from way up here</p>
        <p>It's crystal clear</p>
        <p>That now I'm in a whole new world with you</p>
        
        <p>[Aladdin:] Now I'm in a whole new world with you</p>
        
        <p>[Jasmine:] Unbelievable sights</p>
        <p>Indescribable feeling</p>
        <p>Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</p>
        <p>Through an endless diamond sky</p>

        <p>Prince Ali, yes it is he, but not as you know him</p>
        <p>Read my lips and come to grips with reality</p>
        <p>Yes, meet a blast from your past</p>
        <p>Whose lies were too good to last</p>
        <p>Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!</p>
        
        <p>So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin</p>
        <p>Just a con, need I go on, take it from me</p>
        <p>His personality flaws give me adequate cause</p>
        <p>To send him packing on a one-way trip so his prospects take a terminal dip</p>
        <p>His assets frozen, the venue chosen is in the ends of the Earth</p>
        <p>Salaam, ex-prince Ali!</p>
