Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar

[Genie:] I parachuted down into the Taj Mahal 
I rollerbladed all along the great Great Wall!
I even made the famous Leaning Tower fall
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody!

The Moscow Circus hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus won a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees
Who said "gesundheit" when I sneezed

So now I'm home
Home again with you
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue
(You're always blue)
And the pyramids I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world quite like a friend

Slept like a babe in Bombay on a bed of nails
Moroccans loved my daring dance of seven veils
I single-handedly I even saved the whales
No one was there to hear my tales!

In Acapulco joined a Mariachi band
I rode the ragin' rapids down the Rio Grande
Flew in an air balloon, but when I tried to land
Nobody laughed, or lent a hand

Without you, the Amazon is just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet
And the QEII is just some yacht

Now that I'm home
Home again it's clear
All I ever wanted 
Seems to be right here 
I've traveled east and west
And now I'm back again
And there's nothing in the world quite like a friend 

[Aladdin:] There's nothing in the world

[Jasmine:] Nothing in the whole wide world

[All:] There is nothing in the world quite like a friend

[Genie:] Nothin' in the whole wide world!
