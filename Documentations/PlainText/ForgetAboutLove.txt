Forget About Love 
Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar
Lyrics and music by Patty Silversher and Michael Silversher
Performed by Gilbert Gottfried, Liz Callaway and Brad Kane

[Iago:] Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms

Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrills, the chills
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love

Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush

Love really is revolting
It's even worse than when you're molting
Enough of this fluff
Just forget about love

[Jasmine:] I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter

[Iago:] Oh, how I shudder

[Jasmine:] The first time we kissed

[Iago:] It won't be missed
Forget about his touch

[Jasmine:] I can't forget about his touch

[Iago:] In the scheme of things
It doesn't matter much

[Jasmine:] It matters so much

[Iago:] You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone

[Jasmine:] Hmm-mm-mm-mm

[Both:] Love's filled with compromises

[Iago:] And don't you hate those big surprises?

[Jasmine:] A cozy rendez-vous

[Iago:] Oh, please!

[Jasmine:] Candlelight for two

[Iago:] Oh, geez!

[Jasmine:] Look, you're calling my bluff, I can't

[Iago:] Just

[Both:] Forget about love!

[Jasmine:] I can't forget about my heart

[Aladdin:] I can't forget about my heart

[Jasmine:] And how it felt to fall for you right from the start

[Aladdin:] I'm still falling

[Jasmine:] Whatever we may do

[Aladdin:] Whatever we may do

[Jasmine:] You are here for me, and I'll be there for you

[Aladdin:] I'll be there

[Both:] To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun through rain and thunder

[Aladdin:] A cozy rendez-vous

[Jasmine:] Yes, please!

[Aladdin:] Candlelight for two

[Iago:] Oh, geez!
Enough is enough!

[Aladdin and Jasmine:] We can't forget about love!
