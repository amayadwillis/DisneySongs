Arabian Nights
Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Brian Hannan

Arabian nights
Follow me to a place where incredible feats
Are routine every hour or so
Where enchantment runs rampant
Yes, wild in the streets
Open sesame, here we go

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They tease and excite
Take off and take flight
They shock and amaze

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Pack your shield, pack your sword
You won't ever get bored
Though get beaten or gored you might
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
