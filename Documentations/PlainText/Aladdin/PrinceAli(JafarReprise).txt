[JAFAR]
Prince Ali, yes, it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips and come to grips
With reality

Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say "hello" to your precious Prince Ali!

So, Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on?
Take it from me

His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!

So long, ex-Prince Ali!
