(Spoken)
SalƒÅm, and good evening to you worthy friends. Welcome to the fabled city of Agrabah. City of flying carpets, soaring heroes, famous love ballads and more glitz and glamour than any other fictional city in the world

(Sung)
Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

When the winds from the East
And the suns from the West
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

(Spoken)
And of course, you know what Agrabah's famous for? This magical lamp. Don't be fooled by its "commonplace" appearance, like so many things, it is not what's on the outside but what's on the inside that counts. Woah, got a little deep there for a second. This lamp put Agrabah on the map. You've never been? Well... we can fix that!

(Sung)
Follow me to a place
Where incredible feats
Are routine every hour or so
Where enchantment runs rampant
It's wild in the streets
Open Sesame, here we go
See the dervishes dance
In ridiculous pants
Then romance to your heart's delight
Come on down

[GENIE & COMPANY]
Come on in
Let the magic begin
It's another Arabian Night

Arabian Nights...
Like Arabian Days...
More often than not
Are hotter than hot

[GENIE]
In a lot of good ways

[GENIE & COMPANY]
Arabian Nights...
'Neath Arabian moons...
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes

[COMPANY]
In that magical place
In that mystical land
There's a Genie inside every jar
He'll do all your bidding
Your wish, his command
[GENIE]
It's demeaning, but hey there you are

[COMPANY]
Unbelievable, yes
An unethical mess
Nonetheless, no one's very contrived
You come here and you've
Come to a land where any mountain can move
A land of high intrigue with tricky logistics
By prophets and Mystics

[GENIE]
And I've got statistics to prove

[COMPANY]
Arabian Nights
Arabian Nights

[GENIE, spoken]
Agrabah
Come for the hummus
Stay for the floor-show
Even the poor people
Look fabulous!
And everyone here has a minor in dance
And now, for the softer side of Agrabah
[COMPANY]
Arabian Nights...
Arabian Nights

[GENIE]
And of course, you must watch
Your step here in Agrabah
For danger lurks around
Every corner and ugly bad guys too

[COMPANY]
Arabian Nights

[GENIE]
It's a city where a penniless nobody
Can turn out to be...
A noble somebody

[COMPANY]
Arabian Nights

[GENIE]
It's a place where a princess
Would give up her crown for true love
But her father, the Sultan, is a stickler
For the Ancient ways

And our hero's pals are as
Thick as thieves
"Adorable"... but thieves
Oh, and did I mention...
Everybody sings

[GENIE & COMPANY]
Arabian Nights
Like Arabian Days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Arabian Nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes

[COMPANY]
Arabian Nights...
Arabian Nights...
Arabian Nights...
Arabian Nights...
Arabian Nights...
