Lyrics from Aladdin: The Return of Jafar
Lyrics and music by Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn
Performed by Gilbert Gottfried as Iago

That's it!
I've had it! 
I hate to be dramatic
But it's time for me to fly the coop
Terrific!
Fine!
I'm drawin' the line
Before I wind up in a parrot soup!

I was a fool to let you run the show 
I'm cuttin' ya loose, pal!
Look out below!
Arrividerci!
C'est la vie!
Hope all goes well!
I'm lookin' out for me!

Okay! I'm little
Been playin' second fiddle
And I don't get no respect
I turn the other cheek
But this busted beak
Is the only thanks that I get!

I never found a friend that I can trust
They promise caviar
And leave me eatin' dust!
That's some reward for loyalty
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me!

Oh, I don't need nobody else
I'll never fail
I'll cover my own tail
I can take care of myself!

You know, it just don't pay
To give a hoot
I'm givin' all my heart
What do I get?
The boot!
I'm through wit' dat
I'm flappin' free
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me!
