I've Got My Eyes On You
Lyrics from Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams
Words and Music by Amy Powers and Russ DeSalvo
Performed by Lea Salonga

I know you're scared

and I know what you've been through

Look in my eyes

Can't you see I'm frightened too?

So' let's take one step at a time

I won't give up

That's one thing I swear will be true

For it's said to be wise:

"Keep your eyes on the prize"

and I've got my eyes on you

It's hard to trust

When you've been misunderstood

It's starting now

We'll be treated like we should

So let's take this ride till it's true

I won't give up

That's one thing I swear will be true

And I won't give in

I'm stronger than they ever knew

Don't try to run

'Cause I'll just be there when you do

For it's said to be wise:

"Keep your eyes on the prize"

And I've got my eyes on you

(instrumental)

I won't give up

That's one thing I swear will be true

For it's said to be wise:

"Keep your eyes on the prize"

And I've got my eyes on you
