[GENIE]
(Scat fill) Can you give me a "bada-yada-yada"?
(Aladdin repeat)
Good! Scotty-wop
(Aladdin repeat)
Everybody! Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo
(Audience repeat)
(Scat fill) Hit it!

Wah-wah-wah! (Oh my!)
Wah-wah-wah! (Oh no!)
Wah-wah wah!

Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp

And I'll say:
Mister Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
No no no
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
C'mon whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
Yes sir

We pride ourselves on service
You're the boss
The king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours! True dish
How about a little more Baklava?

There it is
C'mon fellas, help me out
Have some of column "A"
Try all of column "B"
I'm in the mood to help you dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Now watch me sell it

Wah-wah-wah! (Oh my!)
Wah-wah-wah! (Oh no!)
Wah-wah wah!

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this out their little hat?
Can your friends go, poof?
Well, looky here
Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip
And then make the sucker disappear?
So doncha sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your chare d'affaires

I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what-cha wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so
C'mon, yes

Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend like me

Can your friends do this?
No really, can they?
You're welcome

Or maybe, our lucky contestant
Would like to wish for a talent of fame
Welcome to, Dancing With The Scimitars

Grab Aladdin by the hand
Swing him 'round 'till he can't stand
Chicken in the baskets
Barrel in a tree
Never had a friend like me
I would like to bring the house down a little bit
Sing a few old classics
Couple of favourites of mine
I'll get back to you in a second
Thank you!

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Beauty and the...

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collections complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the genie who has everything?

Babadabop bop
Badop bop ba-dop
Babadabop bop
Badop bop bop

And you'll never hear the wolf cry
To the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned

I want adventure in the great wide
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Though he's sitting here
Watch Al disappear
Right before your eyes

Yes!

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends do tap?

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip

Gimme a doggy bag, I'm takin' it home

Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend like me
You ain't never had a friend like me
