[ALADDIN]
Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
And that's everything

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[GUARDS]
Riffraff
Street rat
Scoundrel
Take that

[ALADDIN]
Just a little snack, guys

[GUARDS]
Rip him open, take it back, guys

[ALADDIN]
I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
I could use a friend or two
[ALL]
True

[LADIES]
Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one man rise in crime
I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em

[ALADDIN]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[TRADERS]
Stop, thief
Vandal
Outrage
Scandal
[ALADDIN]
Let's not be too hasty

[WOMAN]
Still I think he's rather tasty

[ALADDIN]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along

[ALL]
Wrong

[ALADDIN]
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats

[GUARDS]
Vandal

[ALADDIN]
One hop ahead of the hump

[GUARDS]
Street rat

[ALADDIN]
One trick ahead of disaster
[GUARDS]
Scoundrel

[ALADDIN]
They're quick, but I'm much faster

[GUARDS]
Take that

[ALADDIN]
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin' all I gotta do is jump

[GUARDS]
Don't let him get away

[ALADDIN, spoken]
Sometimes it's just way too easy
