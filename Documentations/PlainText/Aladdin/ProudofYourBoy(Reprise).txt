[ALADDIN]
Tell the truth, lose the princess
Keep the princess, live a lie
I know that I was a louse and a loafer
You won't get a fight, I agree
I was a goldbrick, a goof-off, no good
So, how did this happen to me?

Proud of your boy
I hope you're proud of your boy
Cause I don't feel any taller or smarter
Or handsome or wise

And now, I know what I have to do
How can I be a prince when it isn't true?
So, I will try to try hard to make you
Proud of Your Boy
