[KASSIM]
Good pals, blood brothers
Me and three others
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

[BABKAK, OMAR, ALADDIN, KASSIM]
Four friends, none closer
Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team

Four guys out poundin' the pavements of Agrabah
Poor guys with one Arabian dream

To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies

[ENSEMBLE]
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

[BABKAK, OMAR, ALADDIN, KASSIM]
Four bums, none better
Not one go-getter
[KASSIM]
Unmotivated in the extreme

[BABKAK]
Folks say, "Hey, go earn a living in Agrabah!”

[OMAR]
“Grow up, go earn the city's esteem!"

[BABKAK, OMAR, ALADDIN, KASSIM]
We say, "Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie!"

[ENSEMBLE]
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

[BABKAK, OMAR, KASSIM]
Four guys out passing the turban in Agrabah

[ENSEMBLE]
For letting off some musical steam

[BABKAK, OMAR, ALADDIN, KASSIM]
That's our finale
'Kay guys, let's blow this alley
[ALL]
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin and
Howzat so far, not bad'n it's
Eight eyes with one impertinent gleam

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
