[ALADDIN] (spoken):
Have you ever imagined what it would be like to take off? Never look back?

[JASMINE] (spoken):
Only every hour of every day

[ALADDIN] (spoken):
What's stopping us?

[ALADDIN]
We'll join a caravan tonight
Count on the stars to be our guides
We'll simply vanish out of sight
Go where the desert road decides
There won't be any obligations

[JASMINE]
Or fathers to obey

[ALADDIN]
Cause we'll be a million miles away
Leave everything behind
When you choose to lose yourself
Who knows what you might find
And once the journey's done
You'll have some faith in me
After a million miles or so
We might feel like we're free
[JASMINE]
Maybe we'll travel on the sea

[ALADDIN]
I'll tend the sails and you can steer

[JASMINE]
Watch the waves roll on endlessly

[ALADDIN]
And the horizon disappear

[JASMINE]
We'll leave all thoughts about the future 'till some future day

[BOTH]
Cause we'll be a million miles away
Leave everything behind
When you choose to lose yourself
Who knows what you might find
And once the journey's done
It won't seem quite so far
After a million miles or so
We'll find out who we are

[JASMINE]
Follow wherever the wind starts blowing
[ALADDIN]
A million miles away
The kind of life people dream of knowing

[JASMINE]
A million miles away

[BOTH]
We'll never turn back we'll just keep on going
Vanishing from the view
Becoming someone new
We'll be a million miles away
Leave everything behind
When you choose to lose yourself
Who knows what you might find
And once the journey's done
We'll have no need to roam
After a million miles or so
We might find out we're home

After a million miles or so
We might find out we're home
