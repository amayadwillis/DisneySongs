[OMAR] (spoken):
What are we going to do? Storm the palace?

[KASSIM] (spoken):
Yes! Storm the palace!

[OMAR] (spoken):
Wait, I didn't mean that!

[BABKAK] (spoken):
That's the spirit!

[KASSIM] (spoken):
Who's up for a little high adventure? Okay first things first, we're going to need weapons

[OMAR] (spoken):
Weapons!? Oh geez, couldn't we just, uh, send a strongly worded letter?

[BABKAK]
Seriously?

[KASSIM]
Maybe I can convince these guys to work out a trade

[BABKAK]
Convince those guys, my lord and master
(That's what I'm doing Babkak)
Well, do it faster, let's be gone
[KASSIM]
Everyone choose a weapon

[OMAR]
Oh I should really be going

[BABKAK]
In wasting time we court disaster

[BABKAK & KASSIM]
Pick up that sword and strap it on

[OMAR]
See I hate weapons because--
This thing is awesome!

[KASSIM]
Fate blows her kiss
Chills your heart
Takes your hand

[BABKAK]
Fate feels like this
Play your part
This was planned
[ALL]
And lo, before you know
You grab your horse, you grab your gear
Your moment's now, your moment's here

It's time for high, high, high adventure
You're off and riding, sabre flashing
Your banner high, your molars gnashing

You feel so dashing on a high, high, high adventure
Get set to give some guy a thrashing
'Cause high adventure's in the air

To the palace!
To the palace!
To the palace!

[KASSIM]
There's high adventure in the air, guys
Someone's out there, guys, someone bad

[OMAR]
Are we there yet?
(No!)
Are we there yet?
(No!)
Are we there yet?
(We're not moving!)
He's got a damsel in despair, guys
Heck, that's not fair, guys, and I'm mad
(Hit it Omar, yeah)

[BABKAK]
Fate blows her kiss
Winks her eye
Plots her scheme

[ALL]
Plots it for Babkak, Omar, and Kassim

And so
We three will go
Until it's through
Until it ends
Here comes Aladdin's only friends
Off on a high, high, high adventure

To confrontations so exciting
They're playing music while we're fighting
Sctatching and biting on a
High, high, high adventure
Feel that adrenaline igniting
'Cause high adventure's in the air

[WOMEN]
Hi
Hi
Hi

[ALL]
Adventure!
Heigh-ho, the stallions are stampeding
With Allah's wisdom ever leading
(My finger's bleeding!) Well, that's
High, high, high adventure
What we've collectively been needing
Is high adventure in the air

Hark! Something calls like a dream from afar
Calls out to Babkak, Kassim and Omar
It's - wait! - the voice of fate
It calls to me, it calls to you
And to Aladdin's motley crew
It's time for high, high, high adventure

Danger to danger we go flying
Completely unafraid of dying
Omar, stop crying, this is
High, high, high adventure

There's no ignoring or denying
The kind of thrills that it's supplying
And the effect's electrifying
When high adventure's in the air
