[KASSIM]
Hail, your attention I crave
Oh ye people of Agrabah
This is your lucky day

[OMAR]
Hail, high and low, great and small
Lucky people of Agrabah
Someone's coming to call
Take it away Babkak

[BABKAK]
Someone who tamed the Cyclops
Then fought forty thieves single hand
He's richer than Croesus
He goes where he pleases
And this time he's chosen your land

[BABKAK, OMAR AND KASSIM]
So here he is now with his band

[ENSEMBLE]
Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey! Hey! Hey!
For Prince Ali
Say hey!
[GENIE]
Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a bright new star! Oh
Come! Be the first on your block
To meet his eye!

Make way
Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Are you gonna love this guy!
Make Way! (Make Way!)
Make Way! (Make Way!)
Make Way!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He once slew seventy Turks
Mustaches, sabres, real jerks!
Who gave those bad guys the works?
[ENSEMBLE]
Why, Prince Ali
Prince, Prince Ali
Prince Ali
Prince, Prince Ali
Prince Ali

[WOMAN]
He's got seventy-five golden camels
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three

[GENIE]
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you
It's a world-class menagerie

Wow!
Prince Ali! Wonderful he
Ali Ababwa
He's essayed quite a parade
For you to see
So get on out in that street
Got someone I wantcha to meet
Come on, start kissing the feet
Of Prince Ali!
Sing hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey to Prince Ali
Sing hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey to Prince Ali

Sounding good fellas
Hit me one more time
Over the top

There's no question this Ali's impressive
Though his entourage may be excessive
All those elephants at once can quite unnerve one
Still, the guy gives a parade new meaning
And the sight of all those peacocks preening
He's a prince without a peer
And we deserve one!

There's no question this Ali's alluring
Never ordinary!
Never boring!
Everything about the man just plain impresses
He's a winner, he's a whizz
A Wonder!
He's about to pull my heart asunder
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkey's, lets see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim
(Love serving him)
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!
Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he!
Ali Ababwa

Heard your Princess was a sight
Lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llama's galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs
His cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali! (Prince Ali)
Say hey to Prince Ali! (Prince Ali)
Say hey, hey, hey to Prince Ali!
