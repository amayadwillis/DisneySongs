[JASMINE]
A princess must say this:
"A princess must marry a total stranger", it's absurd!
Suitors talk of love but it's an act
Merely meant to throw me
How could someone love me when in fact
They don't know me
They want my royal treasure
When all is said and done
It's time for a desperate measure
So I wonder

Why shouldn't I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Sad and confined and always locked behind these palace walls!

[ATTENDANT #1, spoken]
I don't know princess, for someone like you the outside world might be kind of overwhelming

[JASMINE, spoken]
Is that a promise?

[ATTENDANT #2, spoken]
I think it would do her some good

[JASMINE, spoken]
You do?
[ATTENDANT #2, spoken]
Honey I've never seen somebody who needed to get out more

[ATTENDANTS]
Told to show devotion everyday
And not second guess it

[JASMINE]
If a new emotion comes my way

[ATTENDANTS]
You suppress it

[JASMINE]
What would be your suggestion?

[ATTENDANTS]
Stand on your own two feet
And ask why a certain question keeps repeating

[JASMINE]
Why shouldn't I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Follow your heart or you might end up cold and callous

[ALL]
Love comes to those who go and find it
If you've a dream then stand behind it
[JASMINE]
Maybe there's more beyond these palace walls
What if I dared
What if I tried
Am I prepared for what's outside

Why shouldn't I fly so far from here?
Something awaits beyond these palace walls

[ALL]
Something waits beyond these palace walls
