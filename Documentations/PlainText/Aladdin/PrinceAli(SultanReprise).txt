[SULTAN]
Hail! Your attention I pray
Oh, ye people of Agrabah!
This is our lucky day!

[SULTAN] (spoken):
My noble subjects, Princess Jasmine has chosen Prince Ali to be her husband and our next Sultan!

[SULTAN]
Go, cry from the highest mountain tops
Rejoice, raise your voice
Pull out all the stops!
At last, we've a prince who should be glorified!
Ring bells, throw rice
Bang drums, bang them twice!
Ali's gonna wed his bride...!

[ENSEMBLE]
Prince Ali, yes it is he
Ali Ababwa
Favourite son, second to none
Obviously

[SULTAN]
Who made Her Majesty swoon
Who had her changing her tune
And not a moment too soon
[ENSEMBLE]
He's Prince Ali!
