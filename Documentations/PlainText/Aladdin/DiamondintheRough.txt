[JAFAR]
You're the one that I need
You're nimble, stealthy, skilled
Do you want to continue abusing those skills
Stealing bits of bread and worthless baubles
Or do you want to make a name for yourself
And do something that would make any mother proud

You have the profile of a prince
With a physique that matches
Beneath the dirt and patches
You are a diamond in the rough

I say we work together since
You're braver then we two are
We're just as shocked as you are
That you're a diamond in the rough

[ALADDIN]
Hey, I'm no diamond in the rough

[JAFAR]
Under the filth and the fleas there are gifts that you've been neglecting
And truth be told you are not quite the guy that we were expecting
And though you might need finesse, and perhaps some disinfecting
You'll be the one who succeeds when the lamp of their needs collecting
[ALADDIN]
Uh, I dunno guys, I've got a funny feeling about this. I better just be on my way

[JAFAR]
Take one step and die you brainless miscreant!

[IAGO]
Happy place!

[JAFAR]
Apologies
What I meant to say is
You just don't know how swell you are

[IAGO]
You just don't know how swell you are!

[JAFAR]
So far the only hitch is

[IAGO]
There's just an itty bitty hitch

[JAFAR]
You're an embarrassment of riches
[IAGO]
Embarrassing too true!

[JAFAR]
You are the diamond in the rough

[IAGO]
Let's all rejoice the spooky voice said you're the diamond in the
Rooooooough!

[JAFAR]
Look here's the diamond in the

[IAGO]
Three cheers, the diamond in the

[JAFAR & IAGO]
We found the diamond in the rough!

[ALADDIN]
You better find somebody else!

[JAFAR]
There is nobody else

[IAGO]
Talk about the girl
[JAFAR]
Oh
Then, of course there's Princess Jasmine
It's clear she took a shine to you
But, let me be frank
With no cash in the bank
You'll never win her heart
It just tears me apart
To see her slip right through your fingers

[ALADDIN]
Which way is this cave of yours?

[JAFAR]
That a boy!
Go
Through!
You
Might be a bum
But you're one
Of noble spirit

[IAGO]
It's just a cave that might eat you alive
No need to fear it!

[ALADDIN]
Well it's a risk that I might have to take

[JAFAR & IAGO]
We're glad to hear it

[JAFAR]
So please no missteps or blunders

[IAGO]
Cue the Cave of Wonders!

[JAFAR & IAGO]
We've waited long enough

[CAVE OF WONDERS]
Who disturbs my slumber

[ALADDIN]
Uh, it is I, Aladdin

[CAVE OF WONDERS]
You are the diamond in the rough. The one whose worth lies deep within. You may enter

[ALADDIN]
I don't believe it. My mother always said if I only applied myself - If I only believed!

[JAFAR]
We don't have time for self-discovery! Fetch me the lamp. Now!

[ALADDIN]
Wish me luck!

[JAFAR]
Luck!
Goodbye you diamond in the

[IAGO]
Please try you diamond in the

[JAFAR & IAGO]
Don't die you diamond in the rough

[JAFAR]
At last!
