[ALADDIN]
You must feel trapped inside these walls
We'll run away, just you and me
Why not escape as evening falls?
There's a whole world you've yet to see

[JASMINE]
If I go with you, will it be safe?

[ALADDIN]
Sure, do you trust me?

[JASMINE]
What did you just say?

[ALADDIN]
Do you trust me?

[JASMINE]
I'm not sure why, but yes

[ALADDIN]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[JASMINE]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

[ALADDIN]
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[JASMINE]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world

[ALADDIN]
Don't you dare close your eyes
[JASMINE]
A hundred thousand things to see

[ALADDIN]
Hold your breath, it gets better

[JASMINE]
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[ALADDIN]
A whole new world

[JASMINE]
Every turn a surprise

[ALADDIN]
With new horizons to pursue

[JASMINE]
Every moment, red-letter

[BOTH]
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
[JASMINE]
A whole new world

[ALADDIN]
Don't you dare close your eyes

[JASMINE]
A hundred thousand things to see

[ALADDIN]
Hold your breath, it gets better

[JASMINE]
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[ALADDIN]
A whole new world

[JASMINE]
Every turn a surprise

[ALADDIN]
With new horizons to pursue

[JASMINE]
Every moment gets better

[BOTH]
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[ALADDIN]
A whole new world

[JASMINE]
A whole new world

[ALADDIN]
That's where we'll be

[JASMINE]
That's where we'll be

[ALADDIN]
A thrilling chase

[JASMINE]
A wondrous place

[BOTH]
For you and me
