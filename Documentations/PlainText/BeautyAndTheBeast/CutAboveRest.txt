A Cut Above the Rest
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas
Written by Rachel Portman and Don Black
Performed by David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Paige O'Hara

[Lumiere:] To each his own, my friend
You know how to get me stressed
But when it comes to making
Christmas special

[Cogsworth:] I'm a cut above the rest

[Lumiere:] If you could see things clearly
You would say that I've been blessed

[Cogsworth:] You can't hold a candle to my timing

[Lumiere:] Ahh! I'm a cut above the rest

[Belle:] You belong side by side
You should never be apart
Cause when you're both together
You're really twice as smart

[Cogsworth (spoken):] Twice as smart - she does have a point

[Lumiere:] Yes, well, two heads are better than one

[Cogsworth:] I'd say that as a team
We have got to be the best

[Lumiere:] Now we've found something
We both agree on
We're a cut above the rest

[Lumiere and Cogsworth:] There's no doubt that as a team
We two are the very best
Everyone who knows us must agree
We're a cut above the rest

[Lumiere, Cogsworth and Belle:] There's not doubt that as a team

[Belle:] You two are the very best
Everyone who knows you must agree

[Lumiere and Cogsworth:] We're a cut...

[Belle:] A cut above...

[Lumiere and Cogsworth:] Above the rest!
