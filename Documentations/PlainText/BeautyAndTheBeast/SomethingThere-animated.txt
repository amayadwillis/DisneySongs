Something There

[Belle:] There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean, and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

[Beast:] She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

[Belle:] New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

[Castleware:] Well, who'd have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?
Well, who indeed?
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
It's so peculiar

Wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
There may be something there that wasn't there before
There may be something there that wasn't there before
