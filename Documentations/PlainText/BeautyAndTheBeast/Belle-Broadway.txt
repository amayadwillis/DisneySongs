[BELLE]
Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day, like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

[TOWNSFOLK]
Bonjour!
Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[BELLE]
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

[BAKER, spoken]
Good morning, Belle!

[BELLE, spoken]
Oh, good morning, Monsieur

[BAKER, spoken]
And where are you off to today?
[BELLE, spoken]
The bookshop
I just finished the mot wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a—

[BAKER, spoken]
That's nice. Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up!

[TOWNSFOLK]
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

[WOMAN]
Never part of any crowd

[MAN]
'Cause her head's upon some cloud

[TOWNSFOLK]
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

[MAN 1]
Bonjour!

[WOMAN 1]
Good day!
[MAN 1]
How is your family?

[WOMAN 2]
Bonjour!

[MAN 2]
Good day!

[WOMAN 2]
How is your wife?

[WOMAN 3]
I need six eggs!

[WOMAN 4]
That's too expensive!

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life

[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
Ah, Belle

[BELLE, spoken]
Good morning! I've come to return the book I borrowed
[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
Finished already?

[BELLE, spoken]
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new?

[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
Not since yesterday

[BELLE, spoken]
That's alright. I'll borrow this one

[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
That one? But you've read it twice!

[BELLE, spoken]
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, a prince in disguise

[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
If you like it all that much, it's yours

[BELLE, spoken]
But sir!

[BOOKSELLER, spoken]
I insist!

[BELLE, spoken]
Thank you, thank you very much!

[TOWNSFOLK]
Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

[BELLE]
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because—you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!

[WOMAN]
Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel

[SHOPKEEPER]
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

[MAN]
Very different from the rest of us

[TOWNSFOLK]
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

[LEFOU, spoken]
I got it, Gaston! Aw... Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston! You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!

[GASTON, spoken]
I know

[LEFOU, spoken]
No beast alive stands a chance against you
And no girl, for that matter

[GASTON, spoken]
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one

[LEFOU, spoken]
The inventor's daughter?

[GASTON, spoken]
She's the one—the lucky girl
I'm going to marry

[LEFOU, spoken]
But she's—

[GASTON, spoken]
The most beautiful girl in town

[LEFOU, spoken]
I know but—

[GASTON, spoken]
That makes her the best
And don't I deserve the best?

[LEFOU, spoken]
Of course you do!

[GASTON]
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said, "She's gorgeous," and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

[BIMBETTES]
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

[WOMAN]
Bonjour

[GASTON]
Pardon

[BELLE]
Good day

[WOMAN]
Mais oui!

[WOMAN]
You call this bacon?

[WOMAN]
What lovely grapes

[MAN]
Some cheese

[WOMAN]
Ten yards!

[MAN]
One pound

[GASTON]
'Scuse me!

[CHEESE MERCHANT]
I'll get the knife

[GASTON]
Please let me through

[WOMAN]
This bread—

[WOMAN]
Those fish—

[WOMAN]
It's stale!

[WOMAN]
They smell!

[MAN]
Madame's mistaken

[WOMAN]
Well maybe so

[TOWNSFOLK]
Good morning! Oh, good morning!

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[GASTON]
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

[TOWNSFOLK]
Look there she goes
The girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

[WOMAN]
It's a pity and a sin

[MAN]
She doesn't quite fit in

[TOWNSFOLK]
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!
