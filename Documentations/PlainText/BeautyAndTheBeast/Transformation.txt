[Beast]
You came back

[Belle]
If only I'd come here sooner

[Beast]
Maybe it's better this way

[Belle]
No! Don't talk like that
We're together now. Everything will be fine

[Beast]
At least I get to see you one last time

[Belle]
We are home
We are where we shall be forever
Trust in me
For you know I won't run away
From today
This is all that I need
And all that I need to say is...

Don't you know how you've changed me
Strange how I fin'lly see
I found home
You're my home
Stay with me
No! No, please! Don't leave me! I love you

(Instrumental Break)

[Prince]
Belle, look into my eyes!
Belle, don't you recognize
The beast within the man
Who's here before you?

[Belle]
It is you!

[Both]
Two lives have begun now
Two hearts become one now
One passion, one dream
One thing forever true
I love you!
