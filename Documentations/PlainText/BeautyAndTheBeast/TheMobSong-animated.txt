The Mob Song
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast
Music and Lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Richard White as Gaston, with chorus

[Mob:] We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

[Gaston:] So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride

Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast; he's got fangs, razor-sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast

Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead, good and dead!
Kill the Beast!

[Mob:] Light your torch, mount your horse

[Gaston:] Screw your courage to the sticking place

[Mob:] We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Through the mist, through the wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day

It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain
We won't rest till he's good and deceased
Sally forth! Tally ho!
Grab your sword! Grab your bow!
Praise the Lord and here we go!

We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns! Bring your knives!
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Castleware:] Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid, although the danger just increased

[Mob:] Raise the flag! Sing the song!
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!
