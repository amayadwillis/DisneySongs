There are times I think
That no one seems to listen
There are times I think they listen
But don't hear
There are times I think they hear
But something's missing
The thoughts behind the words aren't clear
So, I think they're saying
something they're not saying
They think I mean something
I don't mean at all
Do we raise our voice miscommunicating?
Or simply say nothing at all
Is there another way to say it
In a way that can be heard?
Let me see if I can put it into words

I can hear you, you can hear me
When we listen with our hearts
I understand you, you understand me
That's the place where we can start
Words of kindness and forgiveness
Bring us closer, not apart
When we speak our minds
And listen with our hearts

I can hear you, you can hear me
When we listen with our hearts
I understand you, you understand me
That's the place where we can start
Words of kindness and forgiveness
Bring us closer, not apart
When we speak our minds
And listen with our hearts
And listen with our hearts.
