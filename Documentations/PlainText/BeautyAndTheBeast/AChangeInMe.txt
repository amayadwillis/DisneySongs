Album: Beauty and the Beast
There’s been a change in me
A kind of moving on
Though what I used to be
I still depend upon
For now I realize
That good can come from bad
That may not make me wise
But oh it makes me glad

And I-- I never thought I’d leave behind
My childhood dreams
But I don’t mind
For now I love the world I see
No change of heart a change in me.

For in my dark despair
I've slowly understood
My perfect world out there
Had disappeared for good
But in it’s place I feel
A truer life begin
And it’s so good and real
It must come from within

And I-- I never thought I’d leave behind
My childhood dreams but I don’t mind
I’m where and who I want to be
No change of heart
A change in me

No change of heart
A change in me
