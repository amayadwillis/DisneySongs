As Long As There's Christmas (Reprise)
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas
Written by Rachel Portman and Don Black
Performed by Paige O'Hara as Belle and Bernadette Peters as Angelique

[Angelique:] When I felt lost and lonely
Not a dream in my head
Your words lifted my spirits
I remember what you said

[Angelique:] As long as there's Christmas I truly believe

[Angelique & Belle:] That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive
As long as our guiding star shines above

[Angelique:] There will always be Christmas

[Belle:] So there always will be a time
When the world is filled with peace and love
