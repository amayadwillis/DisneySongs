[BELLE, spoken]
Papa, do you think I'm...odd?

[MAURICE, spoken]
My daughter odd?
Where did you get an idea like that?

[BELLE, spoken]
I don't know
It's just that, well, people talk

[MAURICE, spoken]
They talk about me, too
(sung)
No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly could be saner
Except one uncle who...well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class

[BELLE]
So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them

[MAURICE]
They are the common herd
And you could take my word
You are unique, creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot
No matter what
[BELLE]
No matter what they say
You make me proud I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd

[MAURICE]
It's my intention my invention
Shows the world out there one day
Just what we've got

[BELLE]
No matter what

[MAURICE]
Now some may say all fathers just exaggerate

[BELLE]
That every daughter's great?

[MAURICE]
You are!

[BELLE]
And every daughter tends to say her father's tops

[MAURICE]
She pulls out all the stops
To praise him
[BOTH]
And quite rightly!

[MAURICE]
No matter what the pain
We've come this far I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best

[BELLE]
And daughter too!

[MAURICE]
You're never strange

[BELLE]
Don't ever change

[BOTH]
Youâ€™re all I've got
No matter what
