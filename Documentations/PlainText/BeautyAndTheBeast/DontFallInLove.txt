Don't Fall in Love
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas
Written by Rachel Portman and Don Black
Performed by Tim Curry as Forte

The quickest way to break your heart
Make you depressed and ill
Is to get tangled up inside
The side effects could kill

All passion is a waste of time
A deadly game pour vous
I am your friend, your cher ami
I wouldn't lie to you

If you must love someone, may I suggest
You love yourself! Just think it through
You'll never leave and you will find
You'll get more rest
You'll always feel as good as new
Your freedom is the most
Important thing, my friend

You must be strong, you mustn't bend
Don't talk for hours
Don't send flowers
Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance
Beneath the stars
That shine above
Don't fall in love

As soon as your heart rules your head
Your life is not your own
It's hell when someone's always there
It's bliss to be alone
And love of any kind is bad
A dog, a child, a cat
They take up so much precious time
Now where's the sense in that?

Love takes the wildest heart and makes it tame
If you're turned on, then just turn off
Emotions are a thing all great men overcame
Please, don't make this grande catastrophe
Don't get attached to anyone or anything
There's nothing worse than things that cling

You'll go to pot
You'll turn to drink
You'll never rest
You'll end up mad and
Looking like some
Poor demented dove
Don't fall in love
Don't fall in love
