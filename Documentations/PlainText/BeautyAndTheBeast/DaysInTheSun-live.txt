Days in the Sun
Music from Beauty and the Beast
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Cast

[Young prince:] Days in the sun
When my life has barely begun
Not until my whole life is done
Will I ever leave you

[Cadenza:] Will I tremble again
To my dear one's gorgeous refrain

[Lumiere & Plumette:] Will you now forever remain
Out of reach of my arms

[Mrs. Potts:] Oh, those days in the sun
What I'd give to relive just one
Undo what's done
And bring back the light

[Garderobe:] Oh, I could sing
Of the pain these dark days bring
The spell we're under
Still it's the wonder of us I sing of tonight

[Belle:] How in the midst of all this sorrow
Can so much hope and love endure
I was innocent and certain
Now I'm wiser but unsure

I can't go back into my childhood
[Garderobe:] All those precious days...
[Belle:] One that my father made secure
[Garderobe:] ...couldn't last

[Belle:] I can feel a change in me
I'm stronger now but still not free

[All:] Days in the sun
Will return, we must believe
As lovers do
That days in the sun will come shining through
