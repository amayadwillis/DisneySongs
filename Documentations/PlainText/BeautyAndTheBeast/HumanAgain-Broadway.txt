[LUMIÈRE, spoken]
Ha ha, oui, my friends, the day we have waited for may be at hand.​

[MRS. POTTS, spoken]
Oh, if only that were true, Lumiere.​

[LUMIÈRE, spoken]
Aah, human again.​

[MRS. POTTS, spoken]
Human again.​

[LUMIÈRE, spoken]
Yes, think what that means.​

(sung)
I'll be cooking again, be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again, only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again, chic and sporting again

[MRS. POTTS]
Which should cause several husbands alarm!

[CHIP]
I'll hop down off the shelf
[LUMIÈRE & MRS. POTTS]
And tout de suite be myself

[CHIP]
I can't wait to be human again

[MRS. POTTS & Chorus]
When we're human again, only human again
When we're knickknacks and whatnot's no more

[CHIP]
Little push, little shove
They could, whoosh, fall in love

[MADAME DE LA GRANDE BOUCHE]
Ah chérie, won't it all be top-drawer?
I'll wear lipstick and rouge and I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savior-faire, I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair
It's my prayer to be human again

[COGSWORTH]
When I'm human again, only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
[LUMIÈRE, spoken]
Really? That'd be strange

[COGSWORTH, spoken]
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?

In a shack by the sea, I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

[COMPANY]
When I'm human again
So sweep the dust from the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell any day now

[LUMIÈRE]
Shine up the brass on the door

[FEATHERDUSTER]
Alert the dustpail and broom

[COMPANY]
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand any day now
Open the shutters and let in some air
[MRS. POTTS]
Put these here and put those over there

[COMPANY]
Sweep up the years of sadness and tears
And throw them away

[BELLE, spoken]
When Guinevere heard that Arthur was slain
She stole away to a convent
And no one could ever make her smile again
The end

[BEAST, spoken]
What a beautiful story!

[BELLE, spoken]
Oh, I knew you would like it.​
I would like to ask you for something.​

[BEAST, spoken]
What's that?

[BELLE, spoken]
A second chance.​
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

[BEAST, spoken]
Dinner? Me? With you?
Well, that would be, I mean—oh, yes!

[COMPANY]
When we're human again, only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin' again, we're assumin' again
We'll resume our long lost joie de vivre

We'll be playin' again, holiday'n again
And we're prayin' it's ASAP
When we cast off this pall
We'll stand straight, we'll walk tall
When we're all that we were
Thanks to him, thanks to her
Coming closer and closer and closer
Closer and closer and—

We'll be dancing again, we'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again, only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-three's
We'll be floating again, we'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding, as fine as you please
Like a real human does, I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn' when we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human again!
