Beauty and the Beast (Finale)
Music from Beauty and the Beast
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Audra McDonald, Emma Thompson and Chorus

Winter turns to Spring
Famine turns to feast
Nature points the way
Nothing left to say
Beauty and the Beast

Certain as the sun
Rising in the East
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
