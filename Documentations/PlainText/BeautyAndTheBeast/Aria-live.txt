Aria
Music from Beauty and the Beast
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Audra McDonald

Oh, how divine
Glamour, music and magic combine
See the maidens so anxious to shine
Look for a sign that enhances chances
She'll be his special one

What a display
What a breathtaking, thrilling array
Every prince, every dog has his day
Let us sing with passion, gusto, fit to bust
Oh, not a care in the world!
