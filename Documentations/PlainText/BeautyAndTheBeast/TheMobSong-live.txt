[Mob:] We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

[Gaston:] So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the wood
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast; he's got fangs, razor-sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead, good and dead!
Kill the Beast!

[Mob:] Light your torch, mount your horse

[Gaston:] Screw your courage to the sticking place

[Mob:] We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

[Gaston:] Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this they'll do just as I say

[Lefou:] There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

[Mob:] Sally forth! Tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord, and here we go

[Castleware:] Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid, although the danger's just increased

[Mob:] Raise the flag, sing the song!
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!
