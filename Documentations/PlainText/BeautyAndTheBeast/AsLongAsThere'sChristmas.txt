[Belle:] There is more to this time of year
Than sleigh bells and holly
Mistletoe and snow
Those things come and go
Much deeper than snow
Stronger than the strongest love we'll know
We'll ever know

As long as there's Christmas I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive
As long as there's Christmas we'll all be just fine
A star shines above us lighting your
Way and mine

[Cogsworth:] Just as long as there's Christmas
There will be Christmas pud
Tons of turkey

[Mrs. Potts:] And cranb'ry sauce
And mince pies if we're good

[Lumiere:] Loads of logs on the fire

[Ornaments:] Lots of gifts on the tree
All wrapped up in red ribbons

[Chip:] Wonder if there's one for me

[Cogsworth:] We're due for a party
Where on earth do we start?

[Fi-Fi:] I may wear my tiara
You bought me in Monmartre

[Cogsworth:] All the silver will sparkle

[Mrs. Potts:] And the china will gleam

[Lumiere:] And we'll all be as shiny
As a brand-new centime

[Chip:] After dinner we'll play games

[Mrs. Potts:] Till the morning breaks through

[Lumiere:] Then we'll meet in the garden
This is what we shall do

[Chip:] We will build us a snowman
That will reach to the sky

[Belle:] It will stay up until July

[Belle, chorus:] As long as there's Christmas I truly believe
That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive
As long as there's Christmas we'll all be just fine

[Belle:] There'll always be Christmas
So there always will be a time
When the world is filled with peace and love
