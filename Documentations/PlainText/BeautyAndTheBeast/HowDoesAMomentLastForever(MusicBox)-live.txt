How Does a Moment Last Forever (Music Box)
Music from Beauty and the Beast
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Kevin Kline as Maurice

How does a moment last forever
How can a story never die
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try

Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts
And always will
