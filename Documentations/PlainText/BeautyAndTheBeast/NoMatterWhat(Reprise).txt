[MAURICE]
First prize is nearly mine
It's quite my best invention
So simple, yet complex;
So massive, yet so small
This triumph of design
Will be my old-age pension
That is, provided I can find the fair at all
I must have missed a sign
I should have paid attention
Drat!
That's not a nightingale, and not a mating call
Wolves!
