How Does a Moment Last Forever (Montmartre)
Music from Beauty and the Beast
Music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Tim Rice
Performed by Emma Watson as Belle

This is the Paris of my childhood
These were the borders of my life
In this crumbling, dusty attic
Where an artist loved his wife

Easy to remember
Harder to move on
Knowing the Paris of my childhood
Is gone
