Did you ever wonder what it's like
To wonder from a different point of view?
To try and see life differently
While doing what somebody else might do?
Imagine seeing through a set of different eyes
You just might be surprised
You just might realize
That somebody might be wondering
And wonder what it's like to be like you

A little thought
A little care
A little "when you ever need me, I'll be there"
A little give
A little take
A little "it's ok to make a small mistake"
A little time
A little space
A little chance to help somebody find their place
It isn't much, but it means a lot
It's not a little thing to have a little thought
