[Belle, spoken]
Show me the Beast!

[Maurice, spoken]
That's him! That's him!

[Woman, spoken]
Is it dangerous?

[Belle, spoken]
Oh, no. No, he'd never hurt anyone. I know he looks
Frightful, but he's really very gentle and kind. He's my friend

[Gaston, spoken]
If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for this monster

[Belle, spoken]
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

[Gaston, spoken]
She's as crazy as the old man. She says this creature is her friend
Well, I've hunted wild beasts and I've seen what they can do
The Beast will make off with your children!
He'll come after them in the night

[Belle, spoken]
No, he will never!
[Gaston, spoken]
Forget the old man, I say we kill the Beast!

[Mob, spoken]
Kill him!

[Man]
We're not safe until he's dead

[Man]
He'll come stalking us at night

[Woman]
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite

[D'Arque]
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

[Gaston]
So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist
Through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer
Then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs
Razor sharp ones
Massive paws
Killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar
See him foam
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead
Good and dead!
Kill the Beast!
[Belle, spoken]
No! I won't let you do this!

[Gaston, spoken]
Try and stop us!

[Belle, spoken]
Papa, this is all my fault. I have to go back and warn him

[Maurice, spoken]
I'm coming with you

[Belle, spoken]
No!

[Maurice, spoken]
I lost you once, I won't lose you again!

[Belle, spoken]
Then we'd better hurry

[Gaston, spoken]
We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me?

[Mob, spoken]
I am! I am! I am!
[Mob]
Light your torch
Mount your horse!

[Gaston]
Screw your courage to the sticking place!

[Mob]
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way!

Through a mist
Through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see ev'ry day!

It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
'Til he's good and deceased
Sally forth!
Tally ho!
Grab your sword!
Grab your bow!
Praise the Lord and here we go!

We don't like
What we don't understand
In fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns!
Bring your knives!
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

[Gaston, spoken]
Cut down a tree, and make it a big one! Take whatever
Booty you can find. But remember, the Beast is MINE!

[Mob]
Hearts ablaze
Banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased

Raise the flag!
Sing the song!
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast!
