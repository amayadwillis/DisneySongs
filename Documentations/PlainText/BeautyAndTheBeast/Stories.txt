When I get to know him
We'll find more things to say
One day I will reach him
There has to be a way

Everyone needs someone
He must need someone, too
When I get to know him better
Here's what I will do

I'll read him stories
From picture books
All filled with wonder
Magic worlds where
The impossible
Becomes the everyday

We'll find a mountaintop
And some moonbeams
To sit under
I'll lead because I know the way

So much to discover
I do it all the time
I could live inside bright pages
Where the words all rhyme

We will slay the dragons
That still follow him around
And he'll smile, yes he'll smile
As his dreams leave the ground

Stories and stories
'Bout mermaids, kings
And sunken treasure
Magic worlds where the impossible
Becomes the everyday

I know a tiny place
Just a dot, too small to measure
I'll take him there
I know the way

Stories 'bout heroes
Who overcame their deepest sorrow
They'll put hope into his heart again
He'll cherish every day

He'll find a better world
And the strength to face tomorrow
I'm sure that when he knows the way
He'll want to stay
