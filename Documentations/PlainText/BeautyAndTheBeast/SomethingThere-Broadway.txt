[Belle]
There's something sweet
And almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
But now he's dear, and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

[Madame de la Grande Bouche, spoken]
Come along dearie
Let's get you off those wet things

[Beast]
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

(spoken) Belle, I have something to show you
But first, you have to close your eyes
It's a surprise!

[Belle, spoken]
May I open them?

[Beast, spoken]
Alright, alright. Now!
[Belle, spoken]
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books in my whole life!

[Beast, spoken]
You like it?

[Belle, spoken]
It's wonderful!

[Beast, spoken]
It's yours!

[Belle]
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

(spoken)
Oh, this is one of my favorites!
It's "King Arthur."
Have you ever read it?

[Beast, spoken]
No
[Belle, spoken]
You don't know what you're missing
I'd love to read this again
Wait...you can read this first

[Beast, spoken]
No, that's alright

[Belle, spoken]
No, really, you read it

[Beast, spoken]
Oh, no, you...

[Belle, spoken]
No, you

[Beast, spoken]
No! I can't...

[Belle, spoken]
You never learned to read?

[Beast, spoken]
Only a little, and long ago
[Belle, spoken]
Well, it just so happens that this is the perfect book to read aloud. Come here, sit by me

[Lumiere]
Well, who'd have thought?

[Mrs. Potts]
Well, bless my soul

[Cogsworth]
Well, who'd have known?

[Mrs. Potts]
Well, who indeed?

[Lumiere]
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

[Mrs. Potts]
It's so peculiar

[All]
We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

[Cogsworth]
Perhaps there's something there
That wasn't there before

[Chip, spoken]
What?

[Mrs. Potts]
There may be something there that wasn't there before

[Chip, spoken]
What's there, Mama?

[Mrs. Potts, spoken]
Ssh. I'll tell you when you're older
Come along now. Let's give them some privacy...

[Chip, spoken]
Mama?

[Mrs. Potts, spoken]
Yes, Chip

[Chip, spoken]
Will I ever get to be a boy again?

[Mrs. Potts, spoken]
I hope so

[Chip, spoken]
When will I know?

[Mrs. Potts, spoken]
Soon. If it's to be. It will be very soon now. Come along, son

[Belle, spoken]
Knowing now, that this was indeed the legendary sword called "Excalibur," Arthur tried to pull it from the stone. He tried
Once to no avail. He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out. Then, for the third time, Arthur drew forth the
Sword...

[Beast, spoken]
So that must mean he's the king!

[Belle, spoken]
Wait and see

[Beast, spoken]
I never knew books could do that

[Belle, spoken]
Do what?

[Beast, spoken]
Take me away from this place, make me forget for a little while

[Belle, spoken]
Forget?

[Beast, spoken]
Who I...What I am...

[Belle, spoken]
We have something in common, you know

[Beast, spoken]
What is that?

[Belle, spoken]
In the town where I come from, the people think I'm odd

[Beast, spoken]
You?

[Belle, spoken]
So, I know how it feels to be...different. And I know how lonely that can be
For the third time, Arthur drew forth the sword, and there arose from the people a great shout. Arthur is king

[Beast, spoken]
I told you so...
