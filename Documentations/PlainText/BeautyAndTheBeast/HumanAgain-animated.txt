Human Again
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast
Music and Lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Angela Lansbury, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Jo Anne Worley and chorus

[Lumiere:] I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm

When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm

I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

[Mrs. Potts:] Which should cause several husbands alarm

[Lumiere:] I'll hop down off this shelf
And tout de suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again

[Castleware:] When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks and whatnots no more

When we're human again
Good and human again

[Wardrobe:] Oh, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door

I'll exude savoir-faire
I'll wear gowns; I'll have hair
It's my prayer to be human again

[Cogsworth & Mrs. Potts:] When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more starts making sense

[Cogsworth:] I'll unwind, for a change

[Lumiere:] Really? That'd be strange

[Cogsworth:] Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence

Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

[Castleware:] When I'm human again

So sweep the dust from the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now

Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dust pail and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now

[Dusters:] Open the shutters
And let in some air

[Mrs. Potts:] Put these here
And put those over there

[Castleware:] Sweep up the years
The sadness and tears
And throw them away

We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free

Cheeks a-blooming again
We're assuming again
We'll resume our long-lost joie de vivre

We'll be playing again
Holidaying again
And we're praying it's ASAP

We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again

We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease

When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes

We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding, as fine as you please

Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're finally reborn
And we're all human again!
