[BELLE, spoken]
Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

(sung)
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it?
Madame Gaston
His little wife, ugh

No, sir! Not me!
I guarantee it
I want much more than this provincial life!

I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned...
