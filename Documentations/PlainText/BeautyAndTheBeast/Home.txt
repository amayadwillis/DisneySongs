Yes, I made the choice
For papa I will stay
but I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
you monster!

If you think that what you've done is right
well then....you're a fool,
think again

Is this home
is this where I should learn to be happy
never dreamed
that a home could be
dark and cold
I was told ev'ry day in my
childhood even when we grow old
home will be where the heart is
never the words so true
my heart's far, far away
home is too

Is this home
is this what I must learn to believe in
try to find something good
in this tragic place
just in case
I should stay here forever
held in this empty space
oh but that wont be easy
I know the reason why
my heart's far, far away
home's a lie
What I'd give
to return
to the life that I knew lately
but I know that I can't
solve my problems going back
Is this home
am I here for a day or forever
shut away from the world until
who knows when
oh but then
as my life has been altered
once, it can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change every lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds all of me
My heart's far, far away
Home and free.
