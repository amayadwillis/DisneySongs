Belle (Reprise)
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast
Music and Lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Paige O'Hara as Belle

Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston, his little wife
No sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want so much more than this provincial life

I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned
