Be Our Guest
Lyrics from Beauty and the Beast
Music and Lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury and chorus

[Lumiere:] Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin round your neck, cherie
And we provide the rest

Soupe du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

They can sing
They can dance
After all, miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best

Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then
You'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest

[Castleware:] Beef ragout
Cheese soufflé
Pie and pudding en flambé

[Lumiere:] We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret

You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining

We tell jokes
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

[Beer mugs:] But it's all in perfect taste, that you can bet

[Castleware:] Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest

[Lumiere:] If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

[Castleware:] Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest

[Lumiere:] Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
Suddenly, those good old days are gone

Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

[Mrs. Potts:] It's a guest!
It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured, and thank the lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

With dessert
She'll want tea
And, my dear, that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoeing
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

I'll get warm
Piping hot
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?
Clean it up, we want the company impressed

We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest

[Castleware:] She's our guest

[Mrs. Potts:] She's our guest

[Castleware:] She's our guest

Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
It's ten years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed

With your meal
With your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you, we'll keep going

Course by course
One by one
Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest

Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our guest!
