Belle

Music and Lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
Performed by Paige O'Hara, Richard White, Alec Murphy, Mary Kay Bergman, Kath Soucie and chorus

Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town full of little people
Waking up to say
Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

There goes the baker with his tray like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

Look, there she goes, the girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl, that Belle

Bonjour
Good day
How is your family?
Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive
There must be more than this provincial life

Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because...you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him till chapter three

Now, it's no wonder that her name means "beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui
You call this bacon?
What lovely grapes
Some cheese...
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken

There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look, there she goes, a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl, that Belle!
