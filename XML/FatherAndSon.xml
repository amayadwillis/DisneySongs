            <ln n="1">[Genie:] It's a big, bright, beautiful future</ln>
            <ln n="2">Thank your lucky stars you're alive</ln>
            <ln n="3">You got someone special to talk to</ln>
            <ln n="4">A friend that you can trust for life</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="2">
            <ln n="5">You've been on your own with no family ties</ln>
            <ln n="6">But those solo days are done</ln>
            <ln n="7">You'll be two of a kind</ln>
            <ln n="8">Spending quality time</ln>
            <ln n="9">Together as father and son</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="3">
            <ln n="10">Buildin' model ships</ln>
            <ln n="11">Takin' fishin' trips</ln>
            <ln n="12">Workin' hand in hand</ln>
            <ln n="13">Painting the palace, mowin' the sand</ln>
            <ln n="14">First at ten to go</ln>
            <ln n="15">With your daddy-o</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="4">
            <ln n="16">Once you break the ice</ln>
            <ln n="17">You can postulate paternal advice</ln>
            <ln n="18">See, you're travelling at the speed of life</ln>
            <ln n="19">That's the theory of relatives!</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="5">
            <ln n="20">It's a fine, fantabulous future</ln>
            <ln n="21">I see fruit on the family tree</ln>
            <ln n="22">You'll be great as a grumpy ol' grandpa</ln>
            <ln n="23">Bouncing babies on your knee!</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="6">
            <ln n="24">You can fall asleep on the comfy couch</ln>
            <ln n="25">After playin' one-on-one</ln>
            <ln n="26">Reamin' back-to-back</ln>
            <ln n="27">Betcha wallop the Shaq</ln>
            <ln n="28">Together as father and son</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="7">
            <ln n="29">[Cassim:] May be a bumpy ride</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="8">
            <ln n="30">[Aladdin:] We'll make it side by side</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="9">
            <ln n="31">[Genie:] Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide</ln>
            <ln n="32">Move over, Aladdin</ln>
            <ln n="33">Make room for dad!</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="10">
            <ln n="34">You got a whole new shoulder to cry on</ln>
            <ln n="35">Take a chance now, give it a spin</ln>
            <ln n="36">You've had chums for palin' around with</ln>
            <ln n="37">But you never had a friend like him</ln>
        </p>

        <p n="11">
            <ln n="38">Put your checkered past behind you now</ln>
            <ln n="39">No more living on the run</ln>
            <ln n="40">Face the big, bright, beautiful future</ln>
            <ln n="41">Together together, together, together as father and son</ln>
        </p>
